		<description><![CDATA[I have a bog on our site that we wrote ourselves, but are on the verge of changing to a wordpress blog. There is no need to publish this on your site, but if you could explain what a trackback is and how you use it, I&#039;d be grateful. I assumed that it is a coded url that I would put in an article if I wanted to link to your article, but when I click on trackback on anyone&#039;s site, it doesn&#039;t go anywhere; just like yours, it simply refreshes the page. Wordpress&#039; explanation is really poor - can you help? Thanks, Kennie]]></description>
