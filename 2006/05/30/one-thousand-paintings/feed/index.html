		<description><![CDATA[Its great to have something so unique. I don&#039;t think the Initial artist will do half as well. I wish the paintings were more visually appealing though. My birthday date is still available so thinking of buying it but I read on another site that theres some kind of DateArt being sold in Dublin that has a patterned background in black n&#039; white. Anyone know anything about it? Can&#039;t find much info about it!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is really an interesting story, and one that shows that there still are new idea to be found and being the first one, or atleast the most popular one has some merit and adds to the richness of the world. 
As we are increasingly seeing things happen, solely based on a web buzz, bands get signed, singles get to the top of the charts, the million dollar home page etc. This is another fine example.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[People may scoff (and indeed I probably did when the million dollar homepage was taking off) but his idea seems to be working. Over 400 paintings sold now, with over 200 of those being sold in the last 24 hours. I wonder if things will slow down as things approach the expensive end of 1000 paintings though? Coverage on Boing Boing was clearly a big help for him, but I suspect it might need to be picked up by Wired, BBC, etc to see it through to the end.]]></description>
