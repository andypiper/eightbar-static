Ian, who has been hugely excited about 3D printing for a long time, is going to go nuts over it.) We also talked about putting arbirary text on a surface in Second Life using an image created by a server-side script. We&#8217;d both been independently having the same idea, and Jeff was first to implement and blog it. :-) [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed, sometimes you just want to be a consumer. Though as life gets more complicated and the little slices of time get smaller, then media and entertainment has to weave itself into the rest of the things we do. Like a major extension of product placement in movies. 

It is also about the drive for user created content. The Wiki and blog culture, where people want to be part of the creative process. Equally providers want to tap into the free resource and provide tools and middleware. ARG&#039;s are an example of that, as is Secondlife, and Will Wrights Spore (which both actually got a mention on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbcworld.com/content/clickonline_archive_20_2006.asp?pageid=665&#038;co_pageid=4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;BBC&#039;s Click  online this morning)&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We talked about the ARG impact on TV the other day and once Ian had mentioned it, I started noticing it all over the place.  The new Big Brother title sequence looks to have all kinds of stuff in it.  

I wonder if there&#039;ll be another trend to simplyfy things again.  When people first say Google it looked really clean and fresh compared to the everything on one page look of Yahoo!.  I wonder how long it&#039;ll be till people pine for something simple again.

Its probably my simple brain, but for all the clever programming, I&#039;m still much happier with comfort TV.  The OC, Big Brother, MTV and Sports.  I&#039;m the same with food.  I always go back to Cornflakes, Soup and a cup of tea.]]></description>
