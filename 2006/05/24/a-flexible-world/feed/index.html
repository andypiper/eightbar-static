		<description><![CDATA[Bear in mind that we all happen to work at IBM and this is not an official site. 

We (some of the bloggers) like to see and explore innovative ideas. Being into Second Life I am intrigued at how content has value, and its user created content. Now there are some new tools, changing what can be done.

Being able to have outbound connectivity from Second Life is also going to make new interactions possible (see my next post).

From a personal point of view, I see the metaverse as a way to lift the web and start a whole new set of ways to interact. If there are a standard metaverse container it may well end up like a standard j2ee container, and they power a few business.

I may have mentioend before but SL and things like it feel like the web did in 1997.]]></description>

OK! From IBM&#039;s perspective, can you enlighten me what &quot;whole new set of ideas&quot; were you on about? Why should the IBM management get excited? What Second Life market is there for IBM?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have yet to try the new stuff on the linux client; but I do fear flexible objects are going to be another excuse for my X40&#039;s lowly integrated graphics to struggle.

Still, it is exciting to see this sort of development happen. The httprequest function is much needed - It&#039;ll make this Web3.0 world gain an important piece of Web2.0 functionality. ;)]]></description>
