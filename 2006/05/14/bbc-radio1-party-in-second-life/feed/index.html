		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, it was a fun build. I&#039;m glad evepyone liked it - RRR totally pulled it all together and it really turned out well! I&#039;m sure there will be future events, as BBC has rented the four-simulator area out for at least a year. Stay tuned, more interesting things on the way.

Not sure about the World Cup, but I do know they want to promote more music there, definitely.

		<description><![CDATA[Wahooo Sugababes!  

I wonder if they have any plans for the World Cup?  I know they&#039;d have the broadcast rights problem as I suspect they&#039;re only allowed to transmit the games within the UK, but I think they could still do something else to let people join in with the atmosphere]]></description>
