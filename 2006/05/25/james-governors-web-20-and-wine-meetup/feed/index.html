		<description><![CDATA[I am not normally in to red wines, but last night&#039;s very fine selection, which ranged from &#039;precision&#039; to &#039;french country&#039; to &#039;really fat&#039; to &#039;sofa-licking leatheriness&#039; (a lot better than it sounds).

It was wonderfully informal, unscripted and agenda-free, so we naturally chatted about things that interest us most. If there was a theme to the evening&#039;s conversations, it was probably Web 2.0, but other topics covered included privacy (and whether Google risks becomming the latest &#039;evil empire&#039;), Event Driven Architecture and the much derided &quot;SOA 2.0&quot; term, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mqtt.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MQTT&lt;/a&gt; and lightweight publish/subscribe messaging. Given our history of talking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://eightbar.co.uk/category/second-life/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Second Life&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps it is unsurprising that that one came up. So did towels at Microsoft, and why small benefits have a disproportionately high motivational value. Ben Watson and Tim Brook from Adobe were there, and Ben showed us a lovely Flex demo (narrowly avoiding having James pour wine into his T42p ThinkPad to demonstrate its spill-resistant keyboard). By this point it was well past the advertised closing time of Bedales, and we were getting kicked out. 

It was great to meet all these guys, and I am sure we&#039;ll hook up again.]]></description>
