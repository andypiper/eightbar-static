		<description><![CDATA[Well its not redundant as I think there are benefits to the xml-rpc inblund approach. i.e. you can update more than one SL object at a time with a bundeled called off world. Which is why I have just been augmenting the trigger mechanism not the whole thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A few weeks ago I set up a little service running that whenever email was sent to a particular account on a box, ie email from SL, it would parse the contents and inject the appropriate values into a database. This database could then be used to look-up objects&#039; ids automatically. Fairly clunky I think you&#039;ll agree, and largely redundant now.

I wonder how many similar systems had been concocted prior to the 1.10 release.]]></description>
