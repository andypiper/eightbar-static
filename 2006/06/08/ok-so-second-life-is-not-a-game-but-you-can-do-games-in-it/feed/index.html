		<description><![CDATA[Haven&#039;t had chance to check out anything game-wise beyond the camping casinos, but I have tried sky-diving and sky-boarding :D I&#039;ve done a bit of flying in helicopters and planes! Sim invaders looks quite cool, though.

I keep meaning to take a look at some of the combat games that are on offer but RL keeps getting in the way :P

P.S. Isn&#039;t it time you guys syndicated full feeds? ;)]]></description>
