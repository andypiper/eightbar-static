		<description><![CDATA[[...] Having written a , for me, quite deep expression of my experience with the Regina Specktor album pre-release by Warner it has been great to see all the coverage and postive bloggage about Ethan Kaplan &#8216;blackrim glasses&#8217; at gnomedex. He is a person who &#8216;gets it&#8217;. The people writing about him &#8216;get it&#8217; such as Eric Rice and the people I meet in Second Life and related places all seem to have the same approach and same ideas. Not identical, but birds of a feather. It is important, as Eric writes, that we still work with the rest of the world. No technology or social change just happens overnight. I think that they guys and I here in Hursley have both a creative and future looking point of view, but mix that with practical uses. So it feels like the Metaverse is the place to express this and make a serious and innovative contribution. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An exciting tale of discovery Ian. Interestingly, to me at least, my brother introduced me to Regina Spektor a while ago but I rediscovered her work recently when one of her songs was used in an advert for Sky (featuring crazy vert ramp skateboarding stunts against a stunning canyon backdrop) at the cinema recently. Great to see her delving int Second Life too.

Incidently, anyone seeking validation of grown-up uses of Second Life and other metaverses might appreciate these two links: Ethan Kaplan&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://blackrimglasses.com/archives/2006/05/22/second-life-meets-regina/&quot;&gt;teaser&lt;/a&gt; for the project, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marketwire.com/mw/release_html_b1?release_id=130654&quot;&gt;the press release&lt;/a&gt; announcing it. ]]></description>
