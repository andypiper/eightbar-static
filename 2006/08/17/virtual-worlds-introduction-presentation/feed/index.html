		<description><![CDATA[As people who are so involved in virtual technology, specifically Second Life, I&#039;d be truly interested in what you think about the social aspects of this incredibly cool world.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks guys - I will try a few things out as my experience seems to be worse than it should be, which would indicate a local issue might be making it worse.

I have a work 2meg broadband connection as well at home - so I will try that as a comparison etc]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Steve, performance is certainly an issue as we get global involvement. I believe that this is one thing that Linden are looking at. I don&#039;t get too much of a problem, bearing min mind this is a &#039;slower&#039; oaced experienc than a game is.
Given the massive growth in users of the past 6 months I am not surprised that  there are some perfomance problems. 
As its not our platform though and we are just users all we can do is help to highlight things.
With my official hat on I would say that there are lots of things we have as a company that may help with perfomance and provisioning, certainly my collegues over in events hosting who run Wimbledon.org might be able to offer a helping hand to Linden Labs.
You user expereince though is very different from mine, there is lag sometimes in crossing regions, but in general on a normal line (mine is 4Meg at home) and in the office on a fixed ethernet line I seem to get very good performance unless a sim is loaded with people.
It would be great to be able to host our own servers and be responsible for the performance at teh server end. 
I know that there are a lot of tuning resources, and wireless (in games anyway) can do some odd things. I know not everyone whats to be a network sysadmin, but as Roo say there may be tweaks your end.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Steve

Yes, lag can be a bit annoying. It&#039;s usually not too bad for me (even from here in the sunny UK). Certainly not as bad as what you&#039;re decribing, even in a busy sim. It&#039;s not great, but it seems to be more usable than what you&#039;re seeing. There may be some magic you can do to alleviate some packet loss. 

You might find this entry on the Second Life Wiki about &lt;a href=&quot;http://secondlife.com/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=Experiencing%20packet%20loss&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;packet loss&lt;/a&gt; helpful. I&#039;m really not an expert in this stuff, but I wondering if tweaking your MTU and/or RWIN values might help. My starting point for this stuff is usually &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dslreports.com/tweaks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dslreports.com&lt;/a&gt;. Enjoy, and let me know how you get on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Slightly off topic - feel free to delete so not to clutter up your great post. But being someone that has been investigating Second Life recently I have one BIG problem that to me could prevent take up of Second Life as a collaboration tool etc.

This problem being network lag - with the servers being in San Francisco (I can&#039;t see them doing much about that right now with how Second Life works). I have an 8 meg connection (but seems to run at 4) but I have to open and close the application every 15minutes or so as I can no longer walk etc. I&#039;m always seeing people flying or walking into the distance obviously suffering the same problems.

The packet loss between the uk and us routers seems to be the problem when I look at the network stats. My question (finally) - with you guys being in the UK what is your experience of this?]]></description>
