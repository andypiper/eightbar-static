		<description><![CDATA[Hi Graham, I did exactly the same project a while ago with an IBM Thinkpad X24 (subnotebook) running on a xubuntu with a fluxbox, autologin and autostarting amarok (fetching mp3&#039;s/ogg  through a wireless network from my nas - my wife doesn&#039;t like cat5 cables in the livingroom). The only thing still missing is a working remote control (currently a logitech Harmony 885). I will return and put a comment as soon as I got it (the remote) to work.
Sorry for my broken english

Best regard from Germany

		<description><![CDATA[[...] I thought autologin would be useful too. This will help with (see my previous post) wife acceptance factor number 2 - it has to be easy to use. The less confusing and time taken to boot into the GUI the better.

		<description><![CDATA[Ah yes, I had considered using a phone with either bluetooth or perhaps wifi but neither option suit me (or my phone) very well though.  

All I have used is Linux, LIRC and Amarok on a thinkpad, nothing else aside from the remote control are required.  This is all very well for a proof of concept, but IRDA ports are short range so my remote only works from 3-4 feet away from the laptop so stage 2 will be using a proper IR receiver instead.

If you think about it, and what I really like about this idea, is that a Thinkpad is perfect for media centre use, even more so if it had a long range IR receiver built in.  There is an s-video port to connect to the TV as well as a seperate screen for those times when someone else is watching TV while you&#039;re playing music, they certainly have enough power these days, small, quiet, and if you need more storage that can be hooked up to your network too.  

If/when I build a system to put this into production use at home I will need to think about how I can control it when my wife is watching another TV channel, make sure the graphics card has TV out, build a quiet PC, attach to the network, and make sure it&#039;s not too big and ugly for living room usage.  Actually, why would I do that again, maybe I&#039;ll stick with a thinkpad!  Who knows?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cool project!  I&#039;ve just done something similar but opted for the bluetooth route as my phone and computer have the appropriate hardware.  The project is called bemused (http://bemused.sourceforge.net/) although I used a Java port as my phone isn&#039;t based on the symbian OS (at http://elektron.its.tudelft.nl/~jkohne76/).  It plugs into amarok out of the box if you install kde bluetooth.  Now I can be anywhere in the house and change the song :)]]></description>
