		<description><![CDATA[Wow, my first trackback! I&#039;ve already been woke up 3 times for &quot;exploits&quot; (usually a resident who doesn&#039;t understand the permissions system). It&#039;s made me think it&#039;s time to do a blog on permissions and how they work. I think that will be my next one. Thanks for the trackback!]]></description>
