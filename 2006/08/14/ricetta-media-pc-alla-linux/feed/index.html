		<description><![CDATA[Serial display is a nice idea if you have a terminal server and want to connect remotely.  You could certainly do some nice tricks with that with regards controlling streaming, even from a command line.  Most media players worth their weight generally support some sort of streaming interface though so can easily be done over Ethernet and with a nice web or GUI front end - not something I require myself just yet though!

I&#039;ve just ordered the serial IR dongle I put up in this article so I&#039;ll see what that&#039;s like later this week hopefully.  It&#039;s the one recommended by the LIRC project page so hopefully I&#039;ll be in good shape, and it also has a voltage regulator for use with low voltage machines such as a thinkpad.  The equivalent parts in the UK would have cost me a similar amount so not much point in making one.  I was in Maplin at the weekend and even the best they could do was a USB IRDA receiver, sadly!

I&#039;ve not seen Cajun before so I&#039;ll be sure to check it out, thanks for the tip!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I built an audio jukebox of a similar nature, though it is stand-alone and does not need a tv. It has a serial display such as this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.matrixorbital.com/product_info.php?pName=lcd2041wb&#038;cName=lcd-character-lcds&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;matrix orbital&lt;/a&gt; one. It also uses a serial infrared module, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lirc.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.lirc.org/&lt;/a&gt; for more (I mean to put up my wiring schematic on my site as finding equivalent parts in the UK can be tricky.
Holding it all together is &lt;a href=&quot;http://cajun.sourceforge.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cajun&lt;/a&gt;. Choose your flavour of linux of course (most people use fedora, but I use debian) and you have a standalone jukebox that only needs a stereo!]]></description>
