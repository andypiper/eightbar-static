		<description><![CDATA[[...] I have known Turner Boehm in RL for a long while, so I was more than happy to see he enter Second Life with eightbar. He was straight in modelling and scripting as I would have expected. We had the dematerializing tardis  a little while back, but now he has got serious as I indicated he would, not that Dr Who does not count as serious! Anyway, he has built an modeller in Second Life that, driven by external complex system information ,produces a self organizing atomic looking structure showing how (as in this case) multiple software systems could be interconnected. If full mode the model is able to be manipulated in realtime. I had seen the original as was impressed but after this SL update I popped to North East Hursley island and had a chat with Turner whilst sitting on this fabulous dynamically built structure. The elements and linkages have text associated with them to indicate the nodes and links in the model. The whole thing is very scaleable, imagine a whole sim full of 15000 nodes and links. For the techies and architects among you I think you will get where he is coming from. Everyone else, it looks cool too I think. [...]]]></description>
