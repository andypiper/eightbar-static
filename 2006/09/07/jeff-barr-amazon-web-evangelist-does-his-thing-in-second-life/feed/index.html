It sounds like Jeff has been enjoying a very busy few weeks, so it was great that he could spare an hour to meet up in Hursley for a chat. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I need to spend more time in SL. I was completely unaware and would have like to attend.

As an aside, the Scion brand is especially interesting. It&#039;s heavily targeted at a particular demographic and frequently associates with the &quot;graffiti&quot; crowd... which includes the &quot;urban vinyl&quot; toy niche market. Oddly enough, though the brand seems ripe for online games, they&#039;ve been extraordinarily careful about licensing their brand. So while one will now find Porsche and Lamborghini in an online racing game, I&#039;m not sure any videogame developer has licensed the Scion brand (last I read they&#039;d not licensed the brand to any game dev, but that was a year ago and things change fast).

So Scion moving into SL is actually a very consistent move. If they license to a typical videogame they potentially lose some of the street cred they have and which they seem to be very keen to cultivate. There&#039;s a DIY aspect to SL that must be very appealing to them. For me it&#039;s interesting because the brand is unique in this way and it happens to turn up in many of the areas I&#039;ve been following.]]></description>
