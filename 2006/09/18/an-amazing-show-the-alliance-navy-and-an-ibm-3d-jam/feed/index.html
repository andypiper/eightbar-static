		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s always a pleasure to help out new visitors to Second Life. The Alliance Navy pride themselves on being civil, polite and courteous to visitors to our home in Tethys, and do our best to answer any questions about the AN, or Second Life as a whole. The event was enjoyed by all, and we look forward to participating in more in the future. many thanks to all for giving us this opportunity.

Glad to see my flag-ship, the ANS Militant Resolve made it into the pictures. (third pic, purple craft at the rear.)

The Alliance Navy: We don&#039;t start wars, but we sure do finish them.]]></description>
