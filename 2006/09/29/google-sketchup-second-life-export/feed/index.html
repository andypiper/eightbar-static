		<description><![CDATA[Very nice, I love using Sketch up as well as other 3D programs but the export on most is so damn stressing it makes you want to punch your computer. Tack Wings 3d for example, every uv map I have made has turned out looking lick crap in Second Life and other programs you get lost in, some tack up to much space on your computer and the good ones do not let you export, convert, or import and a few are made for a sirten kind of computer. I knew that Sketch up pro could upload to SL but I don&#039;t want to buy it ether as well as other 3D programs. I always wondered if there was a way to export Sketch up models to SL, I wanted to make a way myself but I do not have the skills to do so. I think it is pretty damn cool that you found a way to do it. I look forward to see how far you get with it.   Good luck:)]]></description>
