		<description><![CDATA[a step toward a higly specialized world, the slightest manifestation of any talent will become a micro consulting service, italian pizza corporation giving 10 cent advice on how to cook pizza with your current firdge content (any thing you have!!), or as it happens today, even more nacked old, young, fat, ugly will show and sell their only talents on realtime fantasy streams. The masses overloads the masses! the crazy loopback! fantastic colors!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The self organizing nature of these systems may lead to an imperfect state. However it is also true to say that not everything dictated by the few is positive or good.
I think the core idea that enables people to be part of what is essentially a service orientated architecture, (which organizationally is not a new idea as many of the worlds population work for a living doing tasks that have been allocated) might just mean that it is easier for people to find their talents and exploit them?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I came across an excellent website at the weekend. &lt;a href=&quot;http://castingwords.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CastingWords&lt;/a&gt; can provide a transcription of an mp3 for $0.42 per minute, usually withing a day. It looks wonderfully easy to use, even letting you select from multiple mp3s in an RSS feed. 

What&#039;s special about the service is that it uses wetware. Thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mturk.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mechinical Turk API&lt;/a&gt; an army of transcribers is unleashed on the problem, meaning you&#039;re more likely to get decent results. 

Here&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mturk.com/mturk/preview?groupId=7VFZNXY61BV4Z7WG0VZ0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;what the system looks like from the other side&lt;/a&gt;. The going rate for &#039;turking&#039; for CastingWords is about $10 per hour of audio. Not bad if you&#039;re a fast typist. Since it would probably take me at least 2 hours to transcribe an hour of audio, I&#039;m more likely to be a customer than a turker here.

It&#039;s such a cool use of the wetware grid to create value that I really want to try it out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[so... human wetware... what about dogs? they can sniff and tell you 1 or 0 :)

or picture this algorithm:

1. web service asks owner&#039;s dog &quot;is she happy or unhappy?&quot; through cctv and the dog&#039;s tail in front of her
2. if happy, do nothing
3. if unhappy, tell another web service to buy her favourite flowers :)
