		<description><![CDATA[The Dolphin....ah, that lovely choice of an eatery when you can&#039;t think of anything better. Perhaps it has improved in the last 5 months?

Looking forward to catching up with you guys again. Hope the sun is still shining.
I&#039;l send you some tales from Singapore...if you&#039;re really that interested :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yay for meeting other IBM bloggers in person. It was odd shaking hands with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-03.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/page/MartinPacker&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-03.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/page/ThePositiveBlog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt; in person for the first time. You&#039;re quite right about blogging leading to more contacts too. We all agreed that our networks have exploded thanks to big blue&#039;s internal blogging infrastructure. 

I notice that the list of Hursley Bloggers over there in the sidebar has been growing quite quickly in the last few months.]]></description>
