		<description><![CDATA[Gentlemen, the Eagle has landed!

The video went live today on the (as in *THE* !!!) IBM home page.

Here&#039;s a slightly more permanent link:

Well worth the effort - I&#039;m delighted with the outcome!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very interesting camera day for you. I must admit it sounds even more exciting than the ones we had with the occasion of the US Open and Atlanta Olympic web sites back in our US days. Hope those gave you some training for this one !]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is funny when you have to perform to camera and deal with people from the media industry. I had similar experiences in the Wimbledon 2004 promo film we did. Having to do an unscripted piece to camera. The make-up person also held the reflective sheet for the camera. She said she was bored and would I like to have some makeup on. It was only a 30 second piece and we managed to do it in 2 takes.

On the converse of that we had some people filming our neighbours for a garden makover program a few years ago. The production crew seemed to think they owned all the houses around, they even wanted to take our bathroom window of its hinges so they could film a &#039;high shot&#039; as they did not have a gantry to do it from. That did not happen though :-)]]></description>
