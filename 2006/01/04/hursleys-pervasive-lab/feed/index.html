		<description><![CDATA[Dear Sir/Madame,

I have recently created a company to look into the use of new technology to help people with mental health problems (http://www.pervasive-technology-lab.org) and I was wondering if IBM are will to collaborate on projects.  The company has recently been awarded funding from the UK government to help people with depression.  The World Health Organisation have estimated that approx 450 million people world wide will suffer from a mental health problem. The company believes this is an important area that could benefit from the use of technology.  For example, Virtual Reality (VR) has been used to provide exposure therapy to help people with phobias, i.e. if you expose a problem to the sufferer they will become so accustomed to their fear that they will no longer have the effect.  Any help that IBM can give would be much appreciated. Even if it is just support.

Many Thanks

Best Wishes
