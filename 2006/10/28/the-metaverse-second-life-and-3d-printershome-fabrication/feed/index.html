		<description><![CDATA[Snowcrash is the book that is most often referenced in association with SecondLife and other virtual worlds. What you&#039;re referring too is more along the lines of Neal Stephenson&#039;s &quot;Diamond Age&quot;, where home fabricators are commonplace and being on welfare means having to deal with the slow trickle of available matter from the public pipe system.

Also, I&#039;d suggest that there is a current booming home fabrication industry: printing.

It&#039;s 2d, but I think fits the same model. You create something from scratch or download text, put it together how you like and then hit a button and your &quot;print fabricator&quot; takes the constituent materials, combines them in the way you specified and outputs your manuscript.]]></description>
