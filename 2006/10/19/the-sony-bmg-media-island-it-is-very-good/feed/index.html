		<description><![CDATA[Great web page, I just came across it and I am already a fan. I recently shed 30 pounds in thirty  days, and I want to share my weight loss success with as many people as possible. If I can lose the weight then any one can. Whatever you do, never give up and you WILL achieve all your weight loss objectives!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] Well it all started on time, DNA Prototype took to the decks at the Aloft hotel party area. The invited guests gathered, danced and talked whilst the music streamed in.  I dont usually do nightclubs anymore, so it was good to let epredator potato throw some shapes. A few of us synched with Satchmo Prototype, he had a dance machine installed in his head, so a simple click of the green noggin and away went your avatar dancing. We had quite a range of invited guests at the event, some new faces and some of the usual crowd. Algernon Spackler was there to, as was Juiceof Prunes, though strangely, and this is one to watch out for, JuiceOf just happened to be at the hotel when the event got locked down. So she was not on the group list but still had access to the island. It felt cool to have someone accidently gate crash. I am guessing the access control is checked on entry?  Anyway lots of people and of course a Smurf were there  Ben folds turned up, in SL and on an audio feed. He was clearly gobsmacked by the reaction of the crowd and both the craziness and immersion. There were a few technical hitches requiring text chat &#8220;is this thinng on&#8221;, but SnoopyB and some of the Sheep were in a RL office with Ben. This added a great deal to the dynamic, and these mixed mode events bring people together more. They were clearly enjoying themselves too. Ben played some music from his new album which sounded great, and answered some questions. The crowd jostled for postion, but respected the stage.   When asked about whether he was a Second Lifer Ben decided to show his technical prowess by playing some of the ringtones he had downloaded to his phone in RL. This was hilarious and sort of set the tone (no pun intended) for the next part of the evening. I did comment how ironic it was as when people who have not got the metaverse bug yet as &#8220;So why would anyone by virtual content&#8221; I usually use the &#8220;Why does anyone by a mobile phone ringtone&#8221;. Anyway it was time to head over to the Sony BMG media Island for its first event. TPing a crowd over led to a little confusion but we all made it I think. SnoopB and Ben had chairs on a stage, but the potential for amusing antics took hold and the party dynamic got a whole lot more interactive. I think you can see from this product placement where this might then go.  Ben had his Duff beer attached, this eventually causes you to reel and fall over, in this case off the stage so it looked like crowd surfing. He is in this shot somewhere, I think he fell on Algernon. Another person shouted that Ben had fallen on them and they would never was this avatar again.  Next thing we know Ben has removed his shirt and dived into the audience with a lightsaber. I was laughing so much that I did not take any more pictures. Apart from Algernon decided to sit and watch from the stage. It was 3am UK time though.  Anway, a successful and once again varied event. Another set of anecdotes to add to the &#8220;back in the early days of the metaverse&#8221; after dinner speaking material for when I retire. [...]]]></description>
