You will be happy to know we have Chris Anderson scheduled to be our keynote speaker at the IBM Rational Software Development Conference in Orlando in June http://www-306.ibm.com/software/rational/events/rsdc2006/

Call for papers is open so maybe you can get justification to travel and a free conference pass by submiting a session to our Open Computing track on leveraging virtual social networking! Disney would be a great vaction for your wife and child ; - )]]></description>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[&#8230;] I was going to write up a post about yesterday&#8217;s virtual interview with Chris Anderson, Wired editor and author of The Long Tail, but eightbar already did a really nice job.  I enjoyed the event (and the book), Hamlet did a nice job as interviewer, and kudos to Millions of Us for organizing this.
