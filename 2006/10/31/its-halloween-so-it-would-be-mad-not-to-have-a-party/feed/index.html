		<description><![CDATA[I missed it too. I hope IBMers will continue to party like this, not least because I want to actually make it to the next one. 

We should think about timezones too. Multiple events? Long-running events with people from different timezones dropping in at the best time for them?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would have loved to come but
(a) it was at 11pm
(b) I couldn&#039;t (and still can&#039;t) download the latest version of Second life.

So, all in all, shucks!

But, thanks for the piccys...looks like it was good fun, and I&#039;ve seen lots of good reviews :)
