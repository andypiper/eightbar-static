		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[&#8230;] So the other week we had the battle of the pre-announcing ad agencies BBH and Leo Burnett, who both claimed to be first. One of them claimed to be the first major agency who owned land in SL when actually the true owner of that claim is probably a third ad agency in Second Life (disclaimer: a client of ESC) who is still keeping quiet until they had something actually open to the public.  None of the three have opened their spaces to the public yet, and it doesn&#8217;t matter who opens their door first, but rather who executes better over time (although it would be best for everyone if they all execute really well). Now eightbar says about Sun&#8217;s recent announcement: &#8220;I thought we had done the first fortune 500 press conference.&#8221; I&#8217;m sure Sun can respond with how their definition of press conference makes their event the first given the definition&#8230; [&#8230;]</p>
