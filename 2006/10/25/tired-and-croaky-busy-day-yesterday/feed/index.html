Cheers for the comments. There&#039;s a copy of my paper up on my weblog which should have all the quotes I used on the slides embedded in it.

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent summary of the event, Roo - and a pleasure to meet you at My So-called 2nd Life. 

Just a small correction regarding my own presentation: I do think Second Life can be used for education purposes. There&#039;s already very interesting e-learning activity going on there, and I&#039;m all for it. My point was simply that there is a large gap in the e-learning market that is not filled by SL or any similar platform right now. 

I fundamentally like Second Life as a participant, but in the presentation I used it (and WebCT) as examples to show what some of the opportunities and challenges are right now for software developers interested in creating a 3D environment that is accessible and lightweight enough to use in mainstream education and training.

In that sense I&#039;m more interested in what Second Life could become than what it currently is - both technically and politically. That&#039;s why it was very encouraging to hear Jim Purbrick (Babbage Linden) talk about the potential open source future of the system, possibilities of integrating it into Firefox extensions, etc.]]></description>
