		<description><![CDATA[I typically develop regular products for manufacturing, but since this past summer I&#039;ve been on retainer to one of the virtual developers working on content and branding for a relatively large project. I prefer not to say just yet. The NDA is probably no longer an issue, but when things are finished I&#039;ll feel more comfortable discussing it.

Glad you enjoyed the post though. Not everyone who visits likes what I have to say!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes the strange element whereby despite all the possibilities it is still good to have some real world tie in to ground an avatar is fascinating. 
I have not really worn trainers for years, got stuck on &quot;workboots&quot; in RL.
But there goes that marketing that I usually ignore, I feel a compulsion to have a real pair now. So I have bought an album and now want shoes.
BTW liked the post you had on companies buying virtual products for players.
I had missed that in all the travelling.
So whevre (sic) have you been working?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been too busy doing work for another vr platform to much time inside SL, so I&#039;ve not seen this. Thanks for posting. Especially interesting to me given the Nike iD/NBA 2k6 I was following last year. I never expected &quot;convergence&quot; to look like a car crash in slow motion.]]></description>
