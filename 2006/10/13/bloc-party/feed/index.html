Does anybody mind if I were to use the pictures in a presentation i&#039;m giving at a community center? I&#039;m showing off some alternative jobs and this would be a great picture to show how complex things have gotten.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] World of Warcraft, Second Life, other MMORPGS - I think the resemblance of these to the Matrix is actually more superficial than anything else.

		<description><![CDATA[[...] Once you put in several hours flailing around learning how to function in Second Life, there isn&#8217;t much to do. That may explain why more than 85% of the avatars created have been abandoned. Linden&#8217;s in-world traffic tally, which factors in both the number of visitors and time spent, shows that the big draws for those who do return are free money and kinky sex. On a random day in June, the most popular location was Money Island (where Linden dollars, the official currency, are given away gratis), with a score of 136,000. Sexy Beach, one of several regions that offer virtual sex shops, dancing and no-strings hookups, came in at 133,000. The Sears store on IBM&#8217;s Innovation Island had a traffic score of 281; Coke&#8217;s Virtual Thirst pavilion, a mere 27. And even when corporate destinations actually draw people, the PR can be less than ideal. Last winter, CNET&#8217;s in-world correspondent was conducting a live interview with Anshe Chung, an avatar said to have earned more than $1 million on virtual real-estate deals, when Chung was assaulted by flying penises in a griefer attack.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[&#8230;] Second Life of course gets a mention together with some examples. IBM for instance use it for mentoring and orientating new employees. IBM have more than one island and am currently having a look at some). Also here’s some screenshots of the GreaterIBMbloc party. Interesting – they have main presentations with break out areas.
