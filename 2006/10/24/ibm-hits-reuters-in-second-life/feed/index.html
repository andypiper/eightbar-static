		<description><![CDATA[I heard Roo&#039;s talk yesterday and I was totally bowled over by the whole thing.  I have spent my entire morning on Second Life as a result.  I&#039;m really interested in the social implications of Second Life - questions like, can the law be collaboratively authored, can this online world have positive social impact on the real world?  I&#039;m going to try and get more into the whole second life thing and find out for myself, but any tips or info on this would be great.]]></description>
