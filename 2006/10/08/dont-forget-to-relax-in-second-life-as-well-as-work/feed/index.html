		<description><![CDATA[Yes csven the cultural aspects, the ethanographic implications are all part of what fascinates me about SL.
Visiting events and meeting new groups, seeing how people react, both out in the general public, but also our eightbar group dynamic are all intriguing. 
We intend to write some of our findings and some of the research elements about this. 
I always tell all the new members of eightbar to go out and explore. As Sl is now the same size as Botson, thats a lot of ground to cover.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d suggest that some of the more important things to learn in SL will come not from playing with the scripting language or other tools, but from observing the people; including and especially those with absolutely no experience in *any* of this. It&#039;s not the tools. It&#039;s the people and the community now, imo.]]></description>
