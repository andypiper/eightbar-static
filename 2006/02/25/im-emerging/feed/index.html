		<description><![CDATA[Hi Roo, you are in a very interesting group at Hursley where I have been about 15 years ago with a group of vistors from Japan on a capability tour and about 8 years ago as member of a AP pervasive computing promotion group. Glad to hear that Hursley maintains a kind of entreprenuerial atmosphere still. The picture reminds of the Lab tour at that time, though lab facility might have changed a lot. Looking forward to hearing a lof of new news from you group soon.

Darren Shaw&#039;s work on Blog Visualization also looks very promising since I am deeply interested in IBM&#039;s intiative for &quot;Enterprise Social Networking&quot; these days.]]></description>
