		<description><![CDATA[Aye, Roo! *notes it down*

Aye, during the NBC event, I came to see the lighting of trees on different NBC sims. Tough day, esp. when I started seeing Live Help light up with all the issues, incl. me noticing I couldn&#039;t pay someone else L$ properly.

Similarly, I also apologize if anyone sees this and tried to IM me while I was there; I wasn&#039;t able to ably handle 50 IM windows at once, in addition to emails and blog posts I needed to do. (It sounds crazy, but I keep tellin&#039; the devs I&#039;d like a big public indicator of how many people are IMing me!)

(That grass at the top always makes me smile: it&#039;s subtle attention to detail like how &quot;eightbar&quot; is slightly obscured behind it. Sweet.)

I hope for better days ahead. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Erm. Look, I just bumped into some eightbar specialists over at NBC, tried saying hello - and was ignored. The IBM guy, when I said hello directly, did respond - but evaporated when there was trouble at the motherland (so he said)...

Folks, I was just saying hello. I mean - what&#039;s up with that?]]></description>
