		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if you or anyone can give me any advice about fabjectory.
I ordered 2 miis in June.  My credit card was chaged for them on June 26 2008.  I have called Mike several times and I have e-mailed him and so far I have had no reply.  It is too late to dispute the charge with paypal, because it has been over 45 days. I&#039;ve been waiting for almost 3 months.
I don&#039;t want to think that I have been ripped off.  If you have any info about the company, could you please let me know. Thank you.  Sharron]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] I am still technically on holiday, but as you all know this stuff is so exciting that its hard to keep away. Today I received a real life parcel with a present from Judge Hocho, one of the earliest members of eightbar in Second Life. Judge had, a while back, created an SL t-shirt for eightbar. He has now turned that into a real one. He very kindly made one for me and one for Algernon and had them shipped over from the US. Now the intersting thing here is that I now have 2 pieces if clothing in real life that match my main AV look. The leather jacket I converted from my real one back to a virtual one as an early experiment, and I have now become attatched to seeing it on my avatar. The eightbar tshirt until now only existed as a virtual one. As you can see from the picture the logo is very neat, and I will be proudly wearing this, and a huge thanks and real life rating points to Judge.  Then of course I have my 3d fabjectory print statue of myself. This affinity we get to some of the virtual assets we have make an interesting point of discussion. It also highlight the fact that the Second Life for many of us is a very real co-existence. Just to add to the confusion, I got rainbow six vegas for the xbox 360 for chrimbo. It was a hoot trying to explain to my dad, who was visiting, why exactly I was plugging something that looked like a camera in, and why my 38 weeks pregnant wife was trying to get a decent profile shot of me with it. Luckily the laughing and initial comedy results did not cause a dash to maternity (though any day now). So I have ended up with less hair, and looking slightly youger if that makes sense, but I am face mapped should any one happen upon the xbox live epredator in Rainbow Six Vegas.

		<description><![CDATA[Ian, 

I&#039;m very glad you&#039;re happy with the figure. The printer itself is loaded up like an inkjet with a couple different bins of tinted glue that are applied to very fine layers of plaster dust to build up a model. 

Once it&#039;s done being fabbed, it&#039;s coated in superglue to give it some more surface strength. 

Thanks again,
