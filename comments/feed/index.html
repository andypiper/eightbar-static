		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I&#039;m currently doing an MSc in Information Systems and am researching Augmented Reality (and also Second Life).

I see from the article above that it is possible to access SL from a mobile device, and from http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=1087 that you can tag geographical locations with extra info. And for a few years mobile devices have been able to detect and communicate with each other. But has anyone has developed an app that combines all three, and is able to overlay a phone owner&#039;s SL identity/avatar/info onto when viewed through another mobile phone?

If not, what would your response be to the idea? E.g. would it be fun to view a crowded conference hall through your mobile phone&#039;s screen and discover that you are in the presence of lots of other SL inhabitants? Or would the bleeding of SL into RL be scary and/or potentially dangerous (e.g. stalker-type unpleasantness)?

I&#039;d be really interested to hear anyone&#039;s initial reaction to the idea.

Many thanks,

K Vincent]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the post -- I&#039;m surprised this Drone hasn&#039;t become more popular.  It certainly switched me from gas rc helicopters to electric quadricopters (at least for now).  Maybe it&#039;s the gotta-have-an-iphone (or ipad) part.  But there&#039;s now (finally) an easy to use Android app:
