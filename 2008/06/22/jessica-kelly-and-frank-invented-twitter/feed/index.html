		<description><![CDATA[oh my.  That just brought back so many memories of how fun it was to invent and think and play... and sometimes that playing really meant something.  Or maybe I had been so into working with Frank and Jess that it never felt like work at all.

Thanks for the memory lane stroll, my brain is happy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a late post but I&#039;m fired up about Twittering.

I agree with AC that email is too spammy. But Twitter feels like spam as well although the product being promoted is usually only the writer&#039;s sense of self-importance or need for self-reflection. 

I&#039;ve been on Twitter for a little while but only sent my first one last night. That was triggered by a colleague being stabbed. Only then did I wish that I had previously published my twitter account - the immediacy suddenly did feel valuable but with only 4 people following why bother? Okay, it&#039;s a nice way of also getting that comment onto my Facebook account, etc.

The horrible side is having people signing up and there being some sort of social duty to reversing the offer if you know them. I don&#039;t want to be inside anyone else&#039;s head and hear their brain dribble...

I would accept Twitters from a whole range of people *if* I knew I wanted to see their posts. Perhaps Twitterers can give my applications some metadata that will allow posts to be filtered by level of importance and relevance to me. Only show me the most relevant 5% as a report once every week (yep, I&#039;m a dinosaur and like to get stuff done). 

We&#039;ve had a long running project called openSocial (yep, older than Google&#039;s that&#039;s why I own opensocial.com and .net) which is meant to improve on email and twitterish apps. I look forward to it seeing the light of day hopefully later this year.

Earlier in the week was at a thing called PubCamp where most people were non-recovering Twitter addicts. Last night I narrowly managed to avoid a Twitter party. *Snort!* Twitter parties! 

Perhaps there&#039;s a virtual world that will come along in which your virtual bot goes around emoting and living out your random Twitters? I guess it will then Twitter it&#039;s collisions or social interactions? &quot;Saying hello to Epredator&#039;s bot again... Bump.&quot; 
There&#039;s no saving us!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the level of interest in others and the willingness to share means different people respond in very different ways to these tools. Personally I find twitter intriguing and useful, but then I an ego-maniac 2.0. I think as with blogs you get out of it what you put in :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Email is too spammy (much like the telephone system has become). Modern personal messaging must involve some form for friend request before messages can be sent, plus the option to unfriend if you no longer wish to be bothered with the sender.

Email and public telephone numbers need to be intercepted and filtered by some form of offshore human agent.]]></description>
