You are always so thoughtful!

Christian will be missed in this arena and I too wish him the best of luck.
I also understand his desires to get back in front of the wave of what he loves, as I too make the same type transitions.

I&#039;ll have more public information in mid July, another benefit to working
for such a large company as IBM you can move around!

Best to Christian in his future endeavors!

Ian thanks for keeping us all close to humanity!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Ian,

Thanks for the kind words.  You are correct, this does not imply that Cisco is walking away from virtual worlds, in fact the interest within the organization has never been higher.

My move is to shake the dust off (or take the handcuffs off) my career and get back to doing what I love most, which is starting new businesses and technologies.  Some of these I have listed on my LinkedIn, but there are many more to come.

We&#039;ll work together soon in one of these new roles (and I&#039;m buying the beers in Los Angeles when we intersect again).

Best, C]]></description>
