		<description><![CDATA[I am not surprised that Philip, Cory and Mark are hitting biz columns. No matter how laggy SL grid is, no matter only less than 60000 consequent users in-world, virtual worlds are big business. And some people, unlike scandal-seekers and hype blowers, are thinking more clearly and follow the news.

Actually, this exchange of people sounds like a good mixture. After all, more or less successful, attempts for different businesses to step into virtual environment it might be refreshing to see joined steps of people who know the world and people who know the business.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is absolutely validation that there are some of the brightest minds involved in Virtual Worlds currently.  Whether or not EMI, or business in general will ever figure out this beast called VW remains to be seen.  Actually, I think VW needs to figure out business.  Scale back, dumb down, apply to the masses...

BTW, a little discussion started on this at our home http://rceuniverse.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=6947

Sorry for my shamelessness :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hmmm.. while I wish Mr O well in his new venture, I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d draw too many conclusions about what this means for the status of Virtual Worlds, though it says quite a lot about the status of Mr O. That said, the print version of The Grauniad accompanied the article with a piccy taken in Second Life... which was nice, I suppose.]]></description>
