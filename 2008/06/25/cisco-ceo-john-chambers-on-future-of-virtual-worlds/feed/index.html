		<description><![CDATA[I agree there is a generational element to this. Though it is also intriguing that in corporate environments it is the older more experience people who are driving the change, having seen the internet get ignored in some organizations until it was too late. So we have as Chris from Sun said &quot;Gamers raising gamers&quot; which has a push. 
We have a similar game at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.powerupthegame.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;powerupthegame.com&lt;/a&gt; to teach science and eco effects, and we have things like the green data center in SL to educate everyone.
Studying the social effects and generational elements is certainly being done in all sorts of ways.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a point in fact about rapid change happening, it is interesting to look at the experiences of the next generation with virtual worlds.  Eco-friendly tween world www.kidscom.com has kids learning about global climate change as they socialize and play similar to how they do in the school yard and their real world neighborhoods.  No one has to tell this generation that this is the future.  Currently they will be influential in helping parents figure out how to use this technology as well as sooner than we like to think, they will be the decision makers for consumption, governance and communication practices on a global level!  Anyone studying this generation to talk about usage behaviors and technology best practices?]]></description>
