		<description><![CDATA[David, to reply on your comment, AI in virtual worlds is just starting to exist. A company developed a virtual pet (dog) that completely is beyond nintendogs for example. This virtual pet already functions on the multiverse platform where it was developed in first instance and if I am correct is currently being worked on to be compatible with RealXtend and should become to opensim as well in the future. The company who made the virtual pet which can be trained, evolves in skill as the owner of the pet spends time with it is going to be open sourced. This will be a first example of AI inside a virtual world. Things like this still have a long way to go but they will become possible and new technical solutions will come out of them.

I looked it up for you, the company is Novamente you can read more about AI here http://technology.newscientist.com/article/mg19726495.700-virtual-pets-can-learn-just-like-babies.html]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As both an AI enthusiast and an AI skeptic :) I would love to see even one example of a usefuli AI-powered avatar in some virtual world somewhere.  The closest I&#039;ve ever seen just puts out a pre-canned paragraph when someone utters any of the corresponding pre-chosen keywords in its hearing; very &quot;A&quot;, not at all &quot;I&quot;, and no more useful than a &quot;click here for more information&quot; menu.  

It&#039;s great fun to talk about using AI in virtual worlds, but it&#039;s not going to work until we can actually do AI.  :)  And we can&#039;t yet.]]></description>
