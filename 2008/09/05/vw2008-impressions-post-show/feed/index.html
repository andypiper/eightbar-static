		<description><![CDATA[I thought you may find it interesting that many of the virtual mutliprojects take reinventing the wheel to a new level. Have many of these Hollywood execs never heard of google-ing before taking on a project. - The Buffy virtual project was started in secondlife a good 14 months ago (http://www.sunnydale-sl.com) and whilst, obviously, an unlicensed fan-project, would have still been a good, established microverse to explore as part of their research.
- Along with my partner I own and run Sunnydale-SL, as any astute reader with a head for PR will have already guessed ;)
