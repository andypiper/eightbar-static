		<description><![CDATA[There is actually quite a lot of molecule rezzing going on in SL, albeit on a smaller scale than rhodopsin (you might want to fix that link btw). You can rez a peptide live on IBM Almaden and there is even an SL Molecular Structure Group (which includes an IBM av) due to have its first meeting later this month. There is a fledgling database of structure availability/deployment hosted off the wiki at http://secondlifemolecules.wikispaces.com/proteins as well as a script that does a little of the parsing from pdb files. As a personal project I&#039;m hoping to produce a toolkit that makes this kind of build more accessible to teachers and students. We had an informal meeting on ANGEL just before Christmas which I recorded on my blog (http://tidalblog.blogspot.com/2007/12/protein-fest-first.html). It was just great seeing those structures rez!
