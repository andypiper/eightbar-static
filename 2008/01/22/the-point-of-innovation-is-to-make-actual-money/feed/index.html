		<description><![CDATA[&#039;Stop Talking, Start Doing&#039;...   you&#039;ve gotta love (ok, perhaps only respect) people who can come up with a 4-word strapline to drive an entire campaign, no doubt costing squillions. And then gasp at the sheer bravado of making a series of ads in which &quot;doing&quot; is entirely absent from the ad.  I get the &quot;stop talking&quot;... but I&#039;m not seeing much in the &quot;start doing&quot;.

The virtual worlds thing? I&#039;m not in Media Studies, so I&#039;m not fully au fait with all the cultural references and the cunning ambiguity (&quot;is it? isn&#039;t it? is it? isn&#039;t it?&quot;) of it. It&#039;s just another example of someone talking out of their backside... like the other ads in the campaign.

It is worth searching YouTube for &quot;Stop talking, start doing&quot; - and watch some of the other ads in the campaign. hehe... How ironic to think of virtual worlders as thin skinned.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Laura, don&#039;t understand why you are combining innovation and pure research.  Two totally different concepts.  You are absolutely right, pure research for its own sake by governments et al is good and should be fostered for what it is.  In business, innovation is taking something existing and doing it better.  And the only reason for that is higher profits. Be that less cost, more revenue, reduced time to market, etc. The ad referenced innovation, and the comment is correct.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have to admit I may be too close to the subject of the ad (being the person inside Dell who evangelizes for our continued explorations in virtual worlds), but my biggest beef with the commercial was the &quot;point of innovation is to make real money&quot; line.  

Having worked at the Superconducting Super Collider (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_Super_Collider) before our US Congress killed the funding for it, innovation and exploration for the sake of just finding out what&#039;s possible is something I value.

And, I just have to wonder (while totally understanding why we&#039;ll never hear) how much money IBM&#039;s clients such as Sears and Circuit City have made... I can admit Prok, that Dell hasn&#039;t made tier from in-world sales.  

Doesn&#039;t mean I don&#039;t think we have received other goodness such as community and brand building from it, though.  Or, that I&#039;ll stop promoting the other benefits we have seen and those that are still out there to be discovered.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So in summary, the ad was trying to say &quot;Don&#039;t hire the kid next door to help you get your company into virtual worlds, hire IBM.&quot;

By the way, IBM took out a two-page ad about virtual worlds in the latest Macleans Magazine, Canada&#039;s main weekly news magazine (Feb. 4 edition, pp. 42-43).  It&#039;s an interview with Chuck Hamilton, New Media and Learning Leader for IBM&#039;s 3D Internet Division.  He&#039;s very upbeat about virtual worlds.  

At the end of the ad, they say &quot;To view the interview, please visit www.macleans.ca/ibm + register for the Innovation in Action Online Summit, May 13, 2008.&quot;]]></description>
