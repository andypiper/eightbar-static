		<description><![CDATA[@csven I agree it as a massive task. Though as the world has developed more into considering Services and API&#039;s between web applications we have less in the way of locked down systems compiled to only work in a confined space. (as it was when i started work 18 years ago).
It is the variety and volume that is the challenge, and when certain applications are happy to gather data in but not let it come out again.
The data interchange is complex but easy compared to the social effects.
e.g. last night in TV the BBC watchdog programme was exposing the sale of personal names and address data. We all know it happens. However it turns out the councils have to sell edited versions of the electoral role to anyone who asks. The Role that we are legally obliged to be part of.
The aim of that access was to keep democracy and abuse of the system by declaring voters publicly. That works but is now being also used by others to hit people with tagretted marketing. 
Thats an unintened consequence. So I suspect there are a lot more hiding for us to discover.]]></description>
