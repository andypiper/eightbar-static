		<description><![CDATA[Its amazing to me how many ways you could go about investing your money. I&#039;ve found for me that best solution is both risky and low risk stocks. I usually put about 1/2 my investments into low risk mutual funds that grow over time plus the other half in high risk high gain stocks. I recently got into day trading and I discovered that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prometheusfinancials.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;software stock picks &lt;/a&gt;are the most reliable as they can automate a process that I cant do quickly enough. The blokes over at PrometheusFinancials.Com have a great system. You might want to check them out!]]></description>
