		<description><![CDATA[Yes, online worlds need spimes, or a spime-orientated culture, in order to understand that the objects talk to us, and we need to learn to listen better. These are manufactured objects, or natural objects. And the SpimeTalk theyâ€™ll generate, as we give a voice to them we can hear, is going to be a rather high intensity communication. Orders of magnitude more intense than twitter.

What this means is that the machine to machine aspect of the communication is the only possible direct means of gathering this information, and we are in dire need of efficiently automating the pattern extraction functions to derive second order knowledge from the raw data. Only then humans are going to be able and act upon what a spimified world is going to tell.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I used the wrong word - &quot;relevant&quot; - above. That should be relative:

&quot;...sometimes that information is &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt; to their surroundings&quot;

Apologies.

That said, I agree that from a systems perspective the environment is effectively inseparable from the object, but the original perspective was what I&#039;d call in this instance an inverted systems approach in that the Object (and its efficient reclamation) was an inseparable issue in regards to the Environment. One&#039;s a top-down approach. The other is a bottom-up.

Put another way, one is corporate and one is DIY.

Adding sensors is a difficult but relatively straight forward technical proposition (and one person I&#039;d credit with advancing the &quot;spime&quot; concept long before it was coined is - last I checked - working on just such spime-like shipping containers as we speak).

Less straight forward is the willingness of companies to encode blueprints into the objects they create and allow anyone to access them; a social issue entangled in all sorts of proprietary strings. I&#039;ve little doubt the biggest issue facing spime-enabled shipping containers is getting accurate and honest disclosures from people trying to hide something.

		<description><![CDATA[@csven I may have abstracted upward a little :-) The motes and Spimes and the principles are veyr similar. We have a balance here of a generic spime saying generic things with emergent behaviour e.g. a spime saying I am hot may well be relevant in gathering surroundings. I still expect there to be custom sensors, as that is what we have a the moment. The key is to pull the information together. 
Really I was pointing out that we need these concepts in virtual worlds as much as real life. :-)
