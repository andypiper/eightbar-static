		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think that taking a screenshot of you in front of a browser in second life is any different to taking a photo of you in front of a browser in real life. 

My understanding is that the usual reasoning here in real life is that if the material in question is in the photo incidentally, in the background, then copyright is not infringed. For example, if you take a photo of your child&#039;s birthday party and there just happens to be a monitor in the background. If that same monitor is part of the subject of the photo, though, then you might have a problem. It is of course up to a court, if necessary, to decide where one situation morphs into the other.]]></description>
