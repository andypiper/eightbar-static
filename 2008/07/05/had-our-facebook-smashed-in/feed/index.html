		<description><![CDATA[Facebook have a problem. They need to crack down of bogus, hoax pages and people representiting identities that they have no rights over. There are clearly worrying possibilities with the wrong identity getting in the wrong hands, with such public support for a fan page, the identity could be abused (and has been in many cases), blemishing the real owner&#039;s brand or name.

I think it&#039;s important that Facebook deal with this but they haven&#039;t found a solution yet and carpet bombing all accounts with this mindless system is not the right approach. I&#039;ve been getting hell just *trying* to even create a page representing a Film Producer which they have entrusted to me - the amount of correspondance between myself as representative, the producer as private entity and facebook themselves over this simple task is still piling up and without results.

With the soon to be launched profile redesign which in my opinion is a collosal disaster, the time is ripe for a new generation social network, if it crops up I reckon users will quite happily switch particularly since the Facebook developer&#039;s API makes data transfer (all account, profile, photo etc. information) so simple and comprehensive. Facebook&#039;s homemade lethal injection is just waiting to be administered.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re so right. FaceBook don&#039;t own us. Is there no appeal process? Frankly, their terms of service should include a form at the bottom which helps them improve their processes. Change is inevitable, embrace or fade, FaceBook.

PS. I can&#039;t find the rules which allowed this group to be deleted. How is this different from say LL setting up an SL group, or one of their fan base from doing the same?]]></description>
