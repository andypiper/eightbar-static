		<description><![CDATA[Well technically this does it from a live speech, it designed to be a puppet or mask for a live chat. As it had voice to text though it seemed worth trying it out. Though I must say that Roo&#039;s Mac had much better voices this is the default microsoft Sam on NT and hence a bit robotic.
I am still amazed by the speed of production. From photo to talking head with enough identity in it, yet clearly not real to not fall into the uncanny valley. 
Obviously the results with a full crazy talk can be much much better with more grapjical talent and attention to detail.]]></description>
