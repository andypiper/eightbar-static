		<description><![CDATA[If this type of generation tools could be fed from the RL urban design and planning data (existing buildings and road maps) the paraverse would come close pretty fast. Add timelines from the RL development history and you can actually see where it goes (went) wrong. And learn and educate about that.
Planning of future development is a concept I have heard others think about too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve got code that spaws whole galaxies with trillions of planets. I haven&#039;t pushed it down to the city level yet, but there&#039;s no reason not to. Arena (Bethseda Games: The Elder Scrolls series) was the first I saw doing this sort of thing. Looks like more of the same, just an increase in complexity.]]></description>
