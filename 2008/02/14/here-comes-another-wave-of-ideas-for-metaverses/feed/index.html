		<description><![CDATA[hyperlinked web3d that has differnent viewers and capabilities does exist on the net, and has for many years.

the FACt that the CONTENT scenes/worlds made by using the different display systems,( even if they all use the same base formats like vrml or x3d or any other format each pundit is paid to promote..) dont CONNECT by CHOICE when it can be done via steps as easy as a hyperlink embed, tells more about the &quot;business visions&quot; of the few funded to build 3d content and applications, then the ability to create a networked 3d BIG meta world that resembles the html linked paged based www.

right now each of the 40 blogged on here and there in the metablog circles are all in an all or nothing 3d metaverse delivery vison that will only lead to many forgotten MMO companies or web3d companies by 2010.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s no question that there will be competition in the marketplace for virtual world providers. There will not be &quot;one big world.&quot; The closest you&#039;ll get to that is something like Google Earth, or There.com, that actually support Earth-size planets with continuous travel. The point there is that there IS a contiguous world. But, just like Google Earth is just one application, and Google Maps is just one web site, there will be other, alternate big worlds, and there will by myriads of small worlds.

The important thing to get right is to make sure that someone who happens to use one technology (Multiverse, Forterra, Linden, whatnot) can still experience the content of all the other technologies. Having to use an &quot;AOL world browser&quot; that only works with AOL-hosted worlds gets old pretty quickly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In building tomorrow space (http://tomorrowspace.com/), which provides persistent copies of event halls to each of our customers, we&#039;re wrestling with a lot of the questions of what the web looks like with many spaces interconnected by hypertext and doors which pop your avatar from one service to another.

In talking with early adopters, it&#039;s clear that a lot of people don&#039;t think of a web of privately hosted 3D spaces as a virtual world, yet so many of the approaches are transferable between the two approaches.  The same feeling of connection with your avatar exists, and some of the same tactics of immersion and play from MMOs are clearly valuable in web spaces.

There has never been One Big World online.  One of the biggest companies touting this idea, Linden Lab, has two complete worlds partitioned by age: Main Grid and Teen Grid.  And there are many more partitions which are just as central to identity and self differentiation.

So the question is not whether we&#039;ll have one big world but how distributed is ownership and how portable is personal representation like appearance and name.]]></description>
