		<description><![CDATA[I suppose that games have long been walled gardens - although I remember chatting to folk about how great it would be to have a racing game and a first person shooter happening in overlapping parts of the same virtual world, so the shooters can watch the racing, and perhaps there are shortcuts for the racers that would take them through battle areas, giving you a choice of extra speed against the danger that one of the fpsers rockets your car.

So openess can help games, but if virtual worlds are &quot;just games&quot; walled gardens are ok.  If they&#039;re a different way of web, then they will have to open up to achieve their potential.

Traditionally, openness is something that allows small companies to compete with the entrenched huge players.  (It&#039;s the only model that could reasonably work against ebay for example), so perhaps we need Sony or someone else to be the 800lb gorilla that forces everyone else to open up...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think Susan necessarily meant to imply that Home itself was &#039;for gamers by gamers&#039;, but the difference between that very pro-UGC language and the reality (as it seems to stand today) of Home was something I felt it would be good to clarify.

I&#039;ve been wondering for a while whether Sony are ignoring the importance of &lt;i&gt;creation&lt;/i&gt; (in addition to say, &lt;i&gt;participation&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;interactivity&lt;/i&gt;) in an interesting virtual world. Or I should probably say, a virtual word that would interest me personally. :-)]]></description>
