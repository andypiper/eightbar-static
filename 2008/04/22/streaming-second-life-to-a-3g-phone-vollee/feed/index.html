		<description><![CDATA[its video streamed to the client, but the client side interactions are sent back to the intermediate client. Remote rendering is an option now. In a way thats how interactive tv works already. You tv does not really render anything but you have a backchannel to send requests.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m trying to get my head around how this was accomplished. Was it literally video that was streamed to the phone, or something more akin to using a VNC server/client?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am not sure to what level the overlay can or will work. I can imagine that it is possible to control the mouse directly on a headless client of this nature. Its early days, but as a design pattern it makes sense.
In fact we trialled this approach at Wimbledon in a 5 minute POC as we were streaming video of SL. 
I watched it using my phone but used a different back channel. In this case a person on the other end controlling the SL responding to directions :-). Its a slightly people intensive approach but asking someone to direct around allows the full interface at the other end to be exploited, whilst delivering to someone who is on a restricted platform via video. Its a bit wetware grid really, but I am sure it will evolve.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting!  The one important class of interaction that they didn&#039;t show is clicking / rightclicking on stuff.  I assume their current implementation doesn&#039;t support it; is it an architectural limitation, or did they just not get to it yet?  Hard to imagine actually using SL without the ability to look at people&#039;s profiles, buy things, touch active objects, etc...]]></description>
