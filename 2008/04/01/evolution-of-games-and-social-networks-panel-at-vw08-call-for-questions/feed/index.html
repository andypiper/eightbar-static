		<description><![CDATA[Thanks everyone. I used several of these questions (didn&#039;t get through them all I&#039;m afraid). I&#039;m working on a summary of the panel, including what I remember of the answers to these questions, which I&#039;ll post here soon. Hopefully I&#039;ll get a recording of the panel from the organizers soon, which will help flesh that out in more detail.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d add to Alan&#039;s question by asking what is the latest thinking on non-player characters (NPCs), their identities and their reputations? The US constitution recognizes corporations as &quot;people&quot;, so can a corporation be represented by an avatar? If so, how is its identity authenticated and how do we establish its reputation?

Beyond the corporation, it&#039;s quite feasible for my intelligent house (or data center) to have an avatar. How do we tie its identity to my house and mine only? How can you trust my house when it asserts something such as the current energy consumption?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a few possible questions for the panel:

&quot;While reputation systems have been useful for transactions systems on the web (e.g. eBay), they&#039;ve haven&#039;t tended to feature as prominently in social networks... for example while a ratings system was added to Second Life it didn&#039;t really take off all that well. Is there a way to implement reputation systems in the social networks of online games (in a way that&#039;s different from player level, scores, or standings)?&quot;

&quot;Part of the success of social networks like Facebook is that they try to be true to your actual identity - the face in facebook is your actual photograph and you&#039;re not supposed to have multiple alts. This all changes in games, where being someone other than yourself is ok, and having multiple characters is often the norm. What&#039;s the impact of having a non-real self to the structure an integrity of a social network?&quot;

&quot;Often, consumer technology is on a more rapid improvement curve than what&#039;s available to enterprises. Today innovations in both virtual worlds and social networks are happening at a breakneck pace, in the process it&#039;s redefining how people collaborate with each other socially. For enterprises, what do these new collaborative processes and environments tell us about how we can collaborate (perhaps using similar technology) more effectively in workplaces?&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@timdp that is an interesting point around why you woudl hit PS3 Home. Though I think the curiosity factor may be a bit more like we seem to have with Xbox Live. I have some peoples gamer cards with the games they are playing/played, the things they have achieved with the points system across games. I suspect Home is more aimed at that. being able to visit Roo&#039;s apartment to either talk to roo and join a game or to see what he has to show off from game acheivements. 
The Xbox, you turnit on it signs in and you are attached to friends, its part of the substrate. If Sony do the same with home then people will end up in there anyway as part of the experience. At the moment you have to launch it like any other game.
I guess thats a question to all the panel &quot;Do you think we benefit from choosing to go to a particular place or site virtual or web based versus it just being there all the time as part of what we do? Is it better to choose a task and be willing to engage with people, or just not really notice that you are engaged because its so pervasive?&quot;
That&#039;s a long question you dont have to ask that becuase it me Roo :-)]]></description>
