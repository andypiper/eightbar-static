		<description><![CDATA[@giff yes I see what you mean, but as we need people to even pay attention in the joke phase before going to threat and then obvious it has to happen in this way I think. 
@glenn its not just second life. You will not be forced to use it for anything any more than you are forced to use the web for anything. I do clearly remember people complaining that this internet thing was just a fad and only for students . we have lots more evidence now of business uses. They do not have to be the same look or mode as Second Life. Though even in that environment there is a diverse set of communities. Some pure entertainment, some more serious. Just as the web, it is poles apart between a homebrew site for a niche interest and corporate presence. 
You are well within your rights, just in in a real life situation to act offensively. However, social norms and etiquettes form. some are more extreme than others. 
If forced into a business meeting in real life at a location you dont like I would suggest that you would conform a little to those around you, same things apply in virtual worlds and metaverses.
It is an interesting point to consider, and I fully appreciate that these ways of interacting may not be for everyone. The key is to make everyone comfortable with which ever way they need to operate I think. 
We can be sure that emails, blogs, websites, screen sharing  and powerpoint are not the pinnacle of human communication over electronic media :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This can be seen on comedycentral.com under Videos - Daily Show.  the title is &quot;Avatar Heroes&quot;.

I personally think 2nd life is a fad that has limited use - maybe as a social site and an enabler for the severely disabled.  If I am forced to use it for business purposes then I will learn how to make the avatar pick its nose, scratch its butt and basically do anything remotely considered rude.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had a slightly different take.  I thought it was funny, just as you did, but I did not see it as an example of virtual worlds seeping into society. I saw it as an example of society keeping it at arms length as the strange, the bizarre, the *other*.  I think this topic still makes a lot of adults nervous.  I&#039;d be interested to hear how kids react to this - do they laugh, or do they go &quot;lame, that old guy just doesn&#039;t *get* it&quot;]]></description>
