		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ian 
I&#039;ll be at Chain Reaction tomorrow and Tuesday - please do make contact. I&#039;m with Community Links who have organised the event and I&#039;ll be co-ordinating the &quot;capture&quot; and sharing online. I&#039;ll be working with a great team of volunteer social reporters and a group of young filmmakers. 

We have also got an exciting collaboration with the guys at www.bestbefore.tv who have set up a very impressive chanell for the event that allows twitter tweets to be displayed in the room as well as images and video taken at the event. Their &quot;VideoBoo&quot; system also enables a really simple video capture and upload which we will be using to recored messages between delegates inside the tent... and those participating online.  

Come and have a look at the applications or view online from tomorrow at www.chain-reaction.org]]></description>
