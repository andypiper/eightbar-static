		<description><![CDATA[A walk down memory lane Ian!    What fun and it reminds me that although it was and at times is a challenging time, it was/is indeed a time connected to friends at work, home and play, without the aggravation or cost of travel.  Not to mention a center of gravity for those past and present IBMers and many others with similar interest to ours!    

The digital world will not play by all the same rules, but there are instances where human interaction transcends analog or digital.  Great Post!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thankyou very much Robbie :) I would love to hear what your take on it is. I wrote to Seth to say thankyou too. He knows what we are doing with virtual worlds as he has clearly read snowcrash &quot;if you see Hiro Protagonist, give him my regards.&quot; was part of the reply :)]]></description>
