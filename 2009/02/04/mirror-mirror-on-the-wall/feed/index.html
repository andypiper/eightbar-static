		<description><![CDATA[Having read this article it too makes me wonder what the future holds. Quite a scary prospect really. The concept in itself seems in theory quite a good idea but in practice can it ever work?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Consder the possibilities for this concept in a military command and control facility. Key people assembled quickly, all &quot;seeing&quot; real incomng data, open discussion and evaluation of the situation, crisis planning and real time, critical decisions made. Participants depart to execute those plans and decisions, meeting again virtually only as necessary.  The virtual decsion center &quot;appears and disappears&quot; as necessary allowing leaders to remain with their units and execute the tasks at hand.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I expect that is where we are headed Wayne. Now we are getting to the point of having meaningful and persistent 3d models, instrumented from real information, and also able to generate real information back out again either visually with overlay/merges etc, physically with 3d printers/rapid fabrications or as simple publish/subscribe messages we have a completed circle. Real can got to virtual, virtual can be made real, as a suitably easy commercial scale. Not locked in an expensive research lab. 
That allows the research and product development to move to its next stages. Things like the seattle company building an imaging contact lense. 
Haptic feedback devices, emotiv headsets etc. all start to for the basis for solutions to problems and also to entertainment experiences. 
The phone can be a catalyst for this, as we have seen with the iphone a massive increase in the use of both multi touch and location based services, without anyone really noticing. It just gets on with it and does what it does.
AR is not new of course, and the great research work and thought leadership that has gone on is now being put in the hands of the general public, so who knows where it will go next. 
We should get to a point where it really does not matter where you are, you can comfortably interact with whoever or whatever you need to in which ever way works, not tied to a qwerty keyboard, mouse and screen. 
(Like the previous post with the coca cola ad and avatars everywhere :) )]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Will this lead a fully augmented reality, with avatars in the virtual world able to occupy the same space as someone within the real world.  Perhaps the real person could visualise and interact with the virtual via an app on their phone and visa versa?]]></description>
