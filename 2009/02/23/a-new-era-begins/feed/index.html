Ian, I wish you all the best, the speed and loads and loads of succes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ian - I just forced Mum to sit and read this blog post, some Twitter and the other blog. At first hesitant, and dare I say it, slightly more interested in Masterchef, after a couple of minutes she was totally engrossed and wanted to read more and more and more. Anyway, we both think you are very brave and wish you the very best of luck! Here&#039;s one in the eye for the big boys, as Mr Branson would say (when he was less of a big boy himself!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why am I always the last to find out? (My own fault for not following twitter as religiously as I should although I did spot an auspicious looking post after we last spoke at the British Library event - I found out from LinkedIn in the end). Enough sour grapes from me - Congratulations Ian. I wish you every success in your new venture. You are one of the pioneers of the new disruptive frontier. To infinity and beyond!]]></description>
