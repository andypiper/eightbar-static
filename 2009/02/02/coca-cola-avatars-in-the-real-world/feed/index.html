		<description><![CDATA[Saw this ad in a Canada.com article on Super Bowl commercials and this ad is a personal fave of mine, that&#039;s why I google and chanced upon this site =D

Another thing to note would be the song used in this ad. Very appropriate. People have become so isolated in their own (virtual) world, an invisible border or distance between one another. All strangers.

There&#039;s something more real in life, Coke, the common interest in most people and it helps to even connect strangers.]]></description>

I found this ad a pleasant, perfect walk down the fine line of showing how avatars are becoming mainstream virtual representations of ourselves and the importance of staying logged into real life. Both are critical parts of society today. It is not one v.s. the other.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is certainly a lot of truth in not judging people on external appearance alone. This tends to be an objection by some people to the use of avatars in virtual worlds, that the avatar may not be an accurate representation of the person that they wish to judge based on appearance. When in fact is is often the case the choice of character or look is often a clearer indication of how that person would like to be seen.
The superhero avatar may well have been someone who wanted to learn to be more helpful and have more honour, but was struggling to come to terms with that, and had to practice it through online expression of that character. 
The other small AV constantly changing their apperence trying to find the one that they felt showed them, or their mood more appropriately is another example. 
The self selecting nature of both virtual worlds and online game environments, and social media site to some extent mean that I feel I connect with more people that I have more in common with than random strangers on the street. Though of course there are random strangers on every virtual street. 
I often use the example og my predator AV in second life. It is clear that I have chosen a science fiction AV, so it is a fair chance the instant someone sees me that I am a science fiction fan. The same would occur in physical space if I was wearing a t-shirt of the same character. However if both cases I was wearing a suit and looking the same as averyone else, that would emote something else, but provide less personal insight to the person seeing or meeting me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[...this might also remind us not to judge people on their external appearance alone -- in real or virtual worlds. 

How easy would it be to discern characteristics from an avatar? 
- was the super-hero on the steps acting &quot;in character&quot; online, whilst seemingly displaying the opposite in real-life : by not offering to help the lady struggling with the pram...?

- - -

&quot;open happiness&quot; : how many get engrossed in their digital activities - to such an extent that they fail to recognise the people in their immediate environment? feeling as a person amongst people; vs feeling as &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; person amongst objects.

...anyone care for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/presscenter/av_advertising.html?vid=6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;some augmented refreshment&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;i&gt;courtesy of coca-cola once again&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@logan @morris That is an interesting angle. Lots of people immersed and the lead guy helps them out as he is a coke drinker, such as the little av trying to get through the door. If coke is smoothing the way, bringing people back into focus then it is a recognition that there is a balance and that it is already happening. Hmmm suddenly I am thirtsy
@csven yes its spot on for AR isnt it :) Seeing things we cant normally see.]]></description>
