		<description><![CDATA[I have to admit I was decidely underwhelmed by the first part, where the controller was just an alternative for navigating an avatar around. The haptics were only really being used to compensate for what would otherwise be quite tricky controls. (I must admit I like to keep my hands on the keyboard, rather than switching between input devices, to the extent that even my desktop keyboard has a trackpoint. So perhaps I&#039;m not the fairest judge here.)

But the second demo... wow. That was something else. It completely blew away any 3D display techniques I&#039;ve seen- instead of worrying about the 2D screen, being able to feel the space really did add another dimension.

I&#039;d really like to see the two combined, allowing the haptic modelling to take place in a shared online space. Exciting stuff.]]></description>
