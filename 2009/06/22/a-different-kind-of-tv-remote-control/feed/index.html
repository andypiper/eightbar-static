No doubt you did your best and I appreciate the fact that this will help as well, you should read other posts as well to make your posting really to the point and really understandable.

There is nothing (at least with my model) to put messages up but MythTV has a little app to do it.  Inbound SMS messages end up on screen along with CallerID message.

I&#039;m still looking for a multi socket power bar that allows you to turn of individual sockets so I can power off the AV amp and a few other things when I&#039;m out as well.

I&#039;ve seen some US and European models with USB ports but all the UK ones seam to be all on/off only.]]></description>
