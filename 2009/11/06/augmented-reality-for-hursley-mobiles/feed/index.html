		<description><![CDATA[A great post and glad you are picking up AR and doing stuff with it on eightbar :)
I was playing with Layar the other day. The Flickr geotagging layer is a great one too. When I was at Southampton Parkway station I took a few pictures on the iphone and geotagged them. One of them was my feeding edge business card. Left floating in the air there :) I hope I see an eightbar gang sign left there next time I travel :) 
Interestingly the Layar guys are busy  
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedingedge.co.uk/blog/2009/10/14/layar-reaches-the-iphone-ar-for-everyone/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;putting 3d in too.&lt;/a&gt;
It starts to merge many of the things we have all been talking about in a very neat way :)]]></description>
