Jo, as you know, eightbar started as something around Hursley, but grew out from there as I mentioned - &quot;eightbar became a bit of a tribe and expanded to included many other folks who were into interesting technology... eightbar is more than just a group of people. It’s a mindset, a grassroots culture.&quot; - I&#039;ve written about this internally as well - others are welcome to contribute.]]></description>
