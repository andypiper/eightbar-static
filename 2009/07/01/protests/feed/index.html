		<description><![CDATA[That is indeed hilarious :) I have to say not being there at the time, I just thought that it was cool that eightbar still has the power to be regarded both a something to have fun with and also with a certain reverence. 
Eightbar is there for everyone to do whatever they want :) including joking about it :) None of the rigorous corporate branding guidelines here. 
So thankyou :) that was brilliant in whatever context.
8bar FTW :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It *totally* was a joke.. and meant in fun. I had (have) no intent on slamming anyone or any group.  The post is maybe a bit out of context here... so...

Possibly a bit of explanation will provide some context. We&#039;ve discussed some questions about use of eightbar ... and the topic keeps coming up... over and over again.  Like flogging a tired horse.  So, that was what drove the somewhat tongue-in-cheek protest.

So, I put the sign on... and it was completely meant as a laugh.  If I offended someone with my sense of humor, well, I apologize!  It was my decision to do it, so the blame lies with me.  I tend to laugh first and think somewhat later.  :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Absolutely - it&#039;s a joke, and it was taken (and posted) as a joke. I was there too and did mention that I was taking a snapshot so I believed this was understood.

This was just a bit of fun at one of our regular meetings - I gave me a laugh so I thought I&#039;d share it - as I said in the post, &quot;no significance&quot; :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[oh my!!!  talk about how there are no secrets and things get taken out of context!!!!!   prime example here.   we LOVE 8 Bar - do not misunderstand.  but....  it is the wrong group affiliation for the purpose being discussed.  :(  no harm/disrespect was meant.   this picture is TOTALLY out of context.  I was there, so I know.]]></description>
