		<description><![CDATA[Hey! I have been to that Sim before! Hehe. Remember the rules for divergent and convergent thinking:

Rules of divergent thinking
		* Defer Judgment
		* Strive for quantity
		* Seek wild ideas
		* Build on other‚Äôs ideas
	Rules of convergent thinking
		* Be affirmative
		* Be deliberate
		* Check objectives
		* Improve ideas
		* Consider novelty]]></description>
