		<description><![CDATA[And &quot;3D printing&quot; is a questionable descriptor as well, since technically it primarily refers to the use of inkjet technology; not all additive methods operate in that manner.

We could use &quot;rapid manufacturing&quot;, but that&#039;s too broad and too ... industry.

We could use &quot;direct digital manufacturing&quot;, but I have a tough time keeping things in order (i.e. sounds like &quot;digital direct&quot;). And it too sounds very industrial.

We could use &quot;fabbing&quot; which sounds personable, but that term includes subtractive methods (e.g. CNC cutting).

We could try &quot;additive fabrication&quot;, but it doesn&#039;t sound PR-friendly, imo.

We might combine terms: digital + additive + fabrication. How does DAF sound? Can you imagine someone using DAF? &quot;I&#039;ll be home late, dear. We&#039;re busy DAFing at the office.&quot;

Let&#039;s try turning it around: fabrication + additive + digital. FAD? hmmm. Maybe not that either.

Perhaps this requires additional thought.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[great epredictions!

btw... anything with &quot;printing&quot; in it sounds very old fashioned - 3d printing seems something from the early 90s when the corporate started talking about printing 3d graphs...

how about a new term for it, that differs from the above?]]></description>
