		<description><![CDATA[I agree, sure, regarding: &#039;just to be&#039; however.... Heh, myspace accomplishes that, and it does so in a big way, but look at the hate piled on by the technocractic elite-- it&#039;s a class issue.

		<description><![CDATA[@Michael I think that is correct. I did not get a complete anti buzz, but if quoted out of context it could look that way. The community around the media or set of media, game , event or sport is what makes the difference. If its a shared interest it should be encouraged.
Obviously in business the shared interest may be different to pure social but the principle still holds of a flag to rally around.
@Eric/Spin (I should have added you got a name check in that podcast :) for community building. I do agree that a context is needed, though in my experience it has been the suprise of the non gamers that this stuff works. Once you cut through any tech filtering, arrow keys to move, free camera movement, many people seem to relate to the non verbal communication as much as the actual thing itself. In a game space this is really self selecting, not everyone is able to understand the engagement or motivation for a pure game. However, that may be the thing we need to evolve, the proper hybrid game or entertainment metaverse. What we need is the equivalent of what the Wii has done to bring gaming to people who just never did, dare I say a casual MMO? If Warcraft is the new golf then we need the equivalent of the new pub for those not needing to cut big business deals, but just to be?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I do find it ironic that if you aren&#039;t one to create media, you might just be more of the social type. Kinda like the podcasters and Twitterers of the world...

I&#039;m convinced most people won&#039;t understand spatial socialization and creation unless it has a video game context to it-- even if they do the exact some stuff in a 2D capacity.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had the opportunity to talk to Leo at Macworld Expo this past week, and while the subject of Virtual Worlds did not come up, I do agree that he has been key in bridging media.  One of the key things that Leo spoke about, while presenting to the crowd, was the importance of forming a community around your media.  With this perspective I would suggest that he may be more anti-second life (as you pointed out on the bubble) than anti-virtual worlds.]]></description>
