		<description><![CDATA[paula, sorry that you feel unhappy on the purpose of eightbar. many of my colleagues feel an afinity to eightbar, not solely as a blog. We were discussing how we need to evolve and have more authors back in the fray from their personal blogs to talk about the other cool projects. I still have a way to go with virtual worlds and that journey has been successful. I am not so sure about having lost my job as that is not the case, it is an evolution of successful evangelism, comes with the territory.
I am sure you will see more from the crew on the smart sensor and eco focused projects, such as joining in on homecamp.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What is the point of this blog?  It keeps mentioning a group who may or may not be part of IBM and opinions that are not IBM&#039;s.  There is only one author and he seems to have lost his job in IBM.  Is this an ego thing? I found it searching for info on IBM but its just an irrelevance and wastes time when searching for IBM]]></description>
