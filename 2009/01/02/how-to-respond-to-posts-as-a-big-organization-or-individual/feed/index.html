		<description><![CDATA[This blog flow chart was well done, of course the Air Force does have it&#039;s rules and regulations to make sure.  Most retail companies have no &quot;strategy in place for blogs, it&#039;s usually just &quot;go get involved in social media&quot; to someone on the internet team.

I think this flow chart would be great if displayed and reviewed at the Internet Retailer in Boston this year as a session.  What do you think?
