			<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dalelane/8877214939/"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5452/8877214939_e5a278a208_n.jpg" alt="WWW2013" width="320" height="220" /></a></p>
<p>Last month I went to the <a href="http://www2013.org/">International World Wide Web Conference</a> for <a href="http://www.w4a.info/2013/">w4a</a>. I saw a lot of cool web technologies and accessibility projects while I was there, so thought I would share links to some of the more interesting bits. </p>
<p>There are too many to put in a single post, so I&#8217;ll write <a href="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?tag=w4a2013">a few posts</a> to cover them all. </p>
<p><strong>Subtitles</strong> </p>
<p>Subtitles and transcripts came up a few times. One study presented looked at online video, comparing <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/giyw9zubmbsgjm2/VR6uUZ04CT/communications/p41-kushalnagar.pdf">single-line subtitle captions overlaid on the video with multi-line off-screen transcripts</a> adjacent to it. </p>
<p>It examined which is more effective from a variety of perspectives, including readability, reader enjoyment, the effect on understanding and so on. In summary, it found that overlaid captions are generally better, although transcripts are better for content which is more technical. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dalelane/8877797446/"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3811/8877797446_653724341e_n.jpg" alt="Real-time transcription from a stenographer at W4A" width="320" height="157" /></a></p>
<p>We had subtitles for all the talks and presentations. Impressively, a separate screen projected a live transcription of the speaker. For deaf attendees, it allowed them to follow what the speaker was saying. For talks given in Portuguese, the English subtitles allowed non-Portuguese speakers like me to understand. </p>
<p>They did this by having live stenographers listening to an audio feed from the talks. This is apparently expensive as stenography is a skilled expertise, and it needs to be scheduled in advance. It&#8217;s perhaps only practical for larger conferences.</p>
<p><strong>Legion Scribe</strong></p>
<p>This was the motivation for one of the more impressive projects that I saw presented : <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/giyw9zubmbsgjm2/jZZX7fXmiw/TPG-challenge/lasecki.pdf">Legion Scribe</a>, which <a href="http://hci.cs.rochester.edu/currentprojects.php?proj=scb">crowd-sourced real-time captioning</a> so that you wouldn&#8217;t need an expert stenographer. </p>
<p>Instead, a real-time audio stream is chopped up into short bits, and divided amongst a number of people using <a href="https://www.mturk.com/">Mechanical Turk</a>. Each worker has to type the short phrase fragment they are given. The fragments overlap, so captions that each worker types can be stitched back together to form captions for the whole original audio stream.</p>
<p><a href="http://hci.cs.rochester.edu/projectpages/pics/scribe_system.png"><img src="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/post-images/130529-scribe-arch.png" border=0/></a></p>
<p>All of this is done quickly enough to make the captions appear more or less in real-time. </p>
<p>Seriously impressive. </p>
<p>And they&#8217;re getting reasonable levels of coverage and accuracy. The system has been designed so that workers don&#8217;t need to be experts in the domain that they&#8217;re transcribing, as they&#8217;re only asked to type in a few words at a time not whole passages. With enough people, it works. If they have at least seven workers, it&#8217;s approaching the coverage you can get with a professional stenographer. </p>
<p><a href="http://hci.cs.rochester.edu/projectpages/pics/scribe_graph.png"><img src="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/post-images/130529-scribe-coverage.png" border=0/></a></p>
<p>Assuming that Mechanical Turk can provide a plentiful supply of workers, then this would not only be cheaper than a stenographer, but also let you start captioning at a moments notice, rather than needing to arrange for a stenographer in advance. </p>
<p><strong>Map Reduce in the browser</strong></p>
<p>Speaking of crowd-sourcing, the idea of splitting up a large computing task between a large number of volunteer computers isn&#8217;t new. <a href="http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/">SETI@home</a> is perhaps the best known, while <a href="http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/">World Community Grid</a> is a recent example from IBM. </p>
<p>But these need users to install custom client software to receive the task, perform it and submit the results. </p>
<p>One project showed how <a href="http://www2013.org/companion/p253.pdf">this could be done in web browsers</a>. A large computing task is divided up into map reduce jobs, which are made available through a website. Each web browser that visits the website becomes a map reduce worker, running their task in the background using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Performance/Using_web_workers">web workers</a>. As long as the user remains on the site, their browser can continue to contribute to the overall task in the background, without the user having had to install custom client software. </p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='450' height='284' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/kRZ8E4FGlTw?version=3&#038;rel=1&%23038;fs=1&%23038;showsearch=0&%23038;showinfo=1&%23038;iv_load_policy=1&%23038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an elegant idea. Not all sites would be well suited to it, but there are plenty of web sites that I keep open all day (e.g. GMail, Remember The Milk, Google Calendar, etc.) so I think the idea has potential. </p>
<p><strong>Migrating browser sessions</strong></p>
<p>An interesting project I saw showed how <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~wohlstad/imagen.pdf">the state of a browser app could be migrated from one browser to another</a>, potentially a different browser running on a different machine even a different platform. </p>
<p>This is more than just the client-server session, which you could migrate by transferring cookies. They&#8217;re transferring the entire state of dynamic AJAX-y pages: what bits are open, enabled, and so on, for any arbitrary web app. </p>
<p>Essentially, they started by wanting to be able to serialize the contents of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window">window</a>, so that it could transferred to another browser where it could be used to restore from. </p>
<p>That wouldn&#8217;t be enough. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window">window</a> doesn&#8217;t have access to local variables in functions, it wouldn&#8217;t have access to most event listeners such as those added with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget.addEventListener">addEventListener</a>, it wouldn&#8217;t have access to the contents of some HTML5 tags like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/HTML/Canvas">canvas</a>, it wouldn&#8217;t have access to events scheduled with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.setTimeout">setTimeout</a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.setInterval">setInterval</a>, and so on. </p>
<p>Serializing <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window">window</a> gets you the current state of the DOM which is a good start, but not sufficient to transfer the state for most web apps. </p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~wohlstad/imagenVideo.html">prototype system called Imagen</a> shows how this could be done. Looking at how they&#8217;ve implemented it, they&#8217;ve had to resort to using a proxy server which intercepts JavaScript going to the browser and instruments it with enough additional calls to let them access all of the stuff that wouldn&#8217;t normally be in scope. This is enough for them to be able to serialize the entire state of the page. </p>
<p>I can see a lot of uses for this, such as in testing, debugging or service scenarios, as well as just the convenience of being able to resume work in progress as you move between devices. </p>
<p><strong>Inferring constraints on REST API query parameters</strong></p>
<p>Many web services include constraints and dependencies for the query parameters. For example: &#8220;this option is always required&#8221;, &#8220;that parameter is optional&#8221;, or &#8220;you have to specify at least one of this or that&#8221;. For example, the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/statuses/user_timeline">twitter API docs</a> explain how you have to specify a user_id or screen_name when requesting a user timeline. </p>
<p>One project I saw was an attempt to <a href="http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/txie/publications/www13-constraints.pdf">automatically infer these rules and dependencies</a> through a combination of natural language processing to recognise them in API documentation, and automated source code analysis of sample code provided for web services. It combines these into an estimated model of the constraints in the REST APIs, which are then verified by submitting requests to the API. </p>
<p>They demonstrated it on APIs like twitter, flickr, last.fm, and amazon, and it was surprisingly effective. </p>
<p><strong>duolingo</strong></p>
<p>Finally, there was a keynote talk on Wednesday by the founder of <a href="http://duolingo.com/">duolingo</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/whyrecaptcha">Captcha</a> is particularly interesting because it uses a task that people need to do anyway (verify that they&#8217;re human) to crowd-source the completion of a task that needs to be done (digitise the text of old books that cannot be read by automated OCR). </p>
<p>Duolingo is similar. It takes a task that people need to do, which is to learn a new language, and uses that effort to translate texts into different languages. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s better explained by their demo video.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='450' height='284' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/WyzJ2Qq9Abs?version=3&#038;rel=1&%23038;fs=1&%23038;showsearch=0&%23038;showinfo=1&%23038;iv_load_policy=1&%23038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been around for a little while, but I&#8217;d not come across it before. Since getting back from www, I&#8217;ve been trying it out. Even Grace has been using it to improve her French and seems to be getting on really well with it.</p>
<p><strong>What else?</strong></p>
<p>There were a lot of other cool projects and technologies that I saw, so I&#8217;ll follow this up with another post or two to share some more links.</p>

			<div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Apologies to the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr">tl;dr</a>&nbsp;brigade, this is going to be a long one...&nbsp;</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">For a number of years I've been quietly working away with IBM research on our speech to text programme.  That is, working with a set of algorithms that ultimately produce a system capable of listening to human speech and transcribing it into text.  The concept is simple, train a system for speech to text - speech goes in, text comes out.  However, the process and algorithms to do this are extremely complicated from just about every way you look at it – computationally, mathematically, operationally, evaluationally, time and cost.  This is a completely separate topic and area of research from the similar sounding text to speech systems that take text (such as this blog) and read it aloud in a computerised voice.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Whenever I talk to people about it they always appear fascinated and want to know more.  The same questions often come up.  I'm going to address some of these here in a generic way and leaving out those that I'm unable to talk about here.  I should also point out that I'm by no means a speech expert or linguist but have developed enough of an understanding to be dangerous in the subject matter and that (I hope) allows me to explain things in a way that others not familiar with the field are able to understand.  I'm deliberately not linking out to the various research topics that come into play during this post as the list would become lengthy very quickly and this isn't a formal paper after all, Internet searches are your friend if you want to know more.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>I didn't know IBM did that?</b></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">OK so not strictly a question but the answer is yes, we do.  We happen to be pretty good at it as well.  However, we typically use a company called Nuance as our preferred partner.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">People have often heard of IBM's former product in this area called Via Voice for their desktop PCs which was available until the early 2000's.  This sort of technology allowed a single user to speak to their computer for various different purposes and required the user to spend some time training the software before it would understand their particular voice.  Today's speech software has progressed beyond this to systems that don't require any training by the user before they use it.  Current systems are trained in advance in order to attempt to understand any voice.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>What's required?</b></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Assuming you have the appropriate software and the hardware required to run it on then you need three more things to build a speech to text system: audio, transcripts and a phonetic dictionary of pronunciations.  This sounds quite simple but when you dig under the covers a little you realise it's much more complicated (not to mention expensive) and the devil is very much in the detail.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">On the audial side you'll need a set of speech recordings.  If you want to evaluate your system after it has been trained then a small sample of these should be kept to one side and not used during the training process.  This set of audio used for evaluation is usually termed the held out set.  It's considered cheating if you later evaluate the system using audio that was included in the training process – since the system has already “heard” this audio before it would have a higher chance of accurately reproducing it later.  The creation of the held out set leads to two sets of audio files, the held out set and the majority of the audio that remains which is called the training set.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The audio can be in any format your training software is compatible with but wave files are commonly used.  The quality of the audio both in terms of the digital quality (e.g. sample rate) as well as the quality of the speaker(s) and the equipment used for the recordings will have a direct bearing on the resulting accuracy of the system being trained.  Simply put, the better quality you can make the input, the more accurate the output will be.  This leads to another bunch of questions such as but not limited to “What quality is optimal?”, “What should I get the speakers to say?”, “How should I capture the recordings?” - all of which are research topics in their own right and for which there is no one-size-fits-all answer.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Capturing the audio is one half of the battle.  The next piece in the puzzle is obtaining well transcribed textual copies of that audio.  The transcripts should consist of a set of text representing what was said in the audio as well as some sort of indication of when during the audio a speaker starts speaking and when they stop.  This is usually done on a sentence by sentence basis, or for each utterance as they are known.  These transcripts may have a certain amount of subjectivity associated with them in terms of where the sentence boundaries are and potentially exactly what was said if the audio wasn't clear or slang terms were used.  They can be formatted in a variety of different ways and there are various standard formats for this purpose from an XML DTD through to CSV.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">If it has not already become clear, creating the transcription files can be quite a skilled and time consuming job.  A typical industry expectation is that it takes approximately 10 man-hours for a skilled transcriber to produce 1 hour of well formatted audio transcription.  This time plus the cost of collecting the audio in the first place is one of the factors making speech to text a long, hard and expensive process.  This is particularly the case when put into context that most current commercial speech systems are trained on at least 2000+ hours of audio with the minimum recommended amount being somewhere in the region of 500+ hours.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Finally, a phonetic dictionary must either be obtained or produced that contains at least one pronunciation variant for each word said across the entire corpus of audio input.  Even for a minimal system this will run into tens of thousands of words.  There are of course, already phonetic dictionaries available such as the Oxford English Dictionary that contains a pronunciation for each word it contains.  However, this would only be appropriate for one regional accent or dialect without variation.  Hence, producing the dictionary can also be a long and skilled manual task.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>What does the software do?</b></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The simple answer is that it takes audio and transcript files and passes them through a set of really rather complicated mathematical algorithms to produce a model that is particular to the input received.  This is the training process.  Once system has been trained the model it generates can be used to take speech input and produce text output.  This is the decoding process.  The training process requires lots of data and is computationally expensive but the model it produces is very small and computationally much less expensive to run.  Today's models are typically able to perform real-time (or faster) speech to text conversion on a single core of a modern CPU.  It is the model and software surrounding the model that is the piece exposed to users of the system.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Various different steps are used during the training process to iterate through the different modelling techniques across the entire set of training audio provided to the trainer.  When the process first starts the software knows nothing of the audio, there are no clever boot strapping techniques used to kick-start the system in a certain direction or pre-load it in any way.  This allows the software to be entirely generic and work for all sorts of different languages and quality of material.  Starting in this way is known as a flat start or context independent training.  The software simply chops up the audio into regular segments to start with and then performs several iterations where these boundaries are shifted slightly to match the boundaries of the speech in the audio more closely.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The next phase is context dependent training.  This phase starts to make the model a little more specific and tailored to the input being given to the trainer.  The pronunciation dictionary is used to refine the model to produce an initial system that could be used to decode speech into text in its own right at this early stage.  Typically, context dependent training, while an iterative process in itself, can also be run multiple times in order to hone the model still further.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Another optimisation that can be made to the model after context dependent training is to apply vocal tract length normalisation.  This works on the theory that the audibility of human speech correlates to the pitch of the voice, and the pitch of the voice correlates to the vocal tract length of the speaker.  Put simply, it's a theory that says men have low voices and women  have high voices and if we normalise the wave form for all voices in the training material to have the same pitch (i.e. same vocal tract length) then audibility improves.  To do this an estimation of the vocal tract length must first be made for each speaker in the training data such that a normalisation factor can be applied to that material and the model updated to reflect the change.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The model can be thought of as a tree although it's actually a large multi-dimensional matrix.  By reducing the number of dimensions in the matrix and applying various other mathematical operations to reduce the search space the model can be further improved upon both in terms of accuracy, speed and size.  This is generally done after vocal tract length normalisation has taken place.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Another tweak that can be made to improve the model is to apply what we call discriminative training.  For this step the theory goes along the lines that all of the training material is decoded using the current best model produced from the previous step.  This produces a set of text files.  These text files can be compared with those produced by the human transcribers and given to the system as training material.  The comparison can be used to inform where the model can be improved and these improvements applied to the model.  It's a step that can probably be best summarised by learning from its mistakes, clever!</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Finally, once the model has been completed it can be used with a decoder that knows how to understand that model to produce text given an audio input.  In reality, the decoders tend to operate on two different models.  The audio model for which the process of creation has just been roughly explained; and a language model.  The language model is simply a description of how language is used in the specific context of the training material.  It would, for example, attempt to provide insight into which words typically follow which other words via the use of what natural language processing experts call n-grams.  Obtaining information to produce the language model is much easier and does not necessarily have to come entirely from the transcripts used during the training process.  Any text data that is considered representative of the speech being decoded could be useful.  For example, in an application targeted at decoding BBC News readers then articles from the BBC news web site would likely prove a useful addition to the language model.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>How accurate is it?</b></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">This is probably the most common question about these systems and one of the most complex to answer.  As with most things in the world of high technology it's not simple, so the answer is the infamous “it depends”.  The short answer is that in ideal circumstances the software can perform at near human levels of accuracy which equates to in excess of 90% accuracy levels.  Pretty good you'd think.  It has been shown that human performance is somewhere in excess of 90% and is almost never 100% accuracy.  The test for this is quite simple, you get two (or more) people to independently transcribe some speech and compare the results from each speaker, almost always there will be a disagreement about some part of the speech (if there's enough speech that is).</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">It's not often that ideal circumstances are present or can even realistically be achieved.  Ideal would be transcribing a speaker with a similar voice and accent to those which have been trained into the model and they would speak at the right speed (not too fast and not too slowly) and they would use a directional microphone that didn't do any fancy noise cancellation, etc. What people are generally interested in is the real-world situation, something along the lines of “if I speak to my phone, will it understand me?”.  This sort of real-world environment often includes background noise and a very wide variety of speakers potentially speaking into a non-optimal recording device.  Even this can be a complicated answer for the purposes of accuracy.  We're talking about free, conversational style, speech in this blog post and there's a huge different in recognising any and all words versus recognising a small set of command and control words for if you wanted your phone to perform a specific action.  In conclusion then, we can only really speak about the art of the possible and what has been achieved before.  If you want to know about accuracy for your particular situation and your particular voice on your particular device then you'd have to test it!</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>What words can it understand?  What about slang?</b></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The range of understanding of a speech to text system is dependent on the training material.  At present, the state of the art systems are based on dictionaries of words and don't generally attempt to recognise new words for which an entry in the dictionary has not been found (although these types of systems are available separately and could be combined into a speech to text solution if necessary).  So the number and range of words understood by a speech to text system is currently (and I'm generalising here) a function of the number and range of words used in the training material.  It doesn't really matter what these words are, whether they're conversational and slang terms or proper dictionary terms, so long as the system was trained on those then it should be able to recognise them again during a decode.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>Updates and Maintenance</b></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">For the more discerning reader, you'll have realised by now a fundamental flaw in the plan laid out thus far.  Language changes over time, people use new words and the meaning of words changes within the language we use.  Text-speak is one of the new kids on the block in this area.  It would be extremely cumbersome to need to train an entire new model each time you wished to update your previous one in order to include some set of new language capability.  The models produced are able to be modified and updated with these changes without the need to go back to a full standing start and training from scratch all over again.  It's possible to take your existing model built from the set of data you had available at a particular point in time and use this to bootstrap the creation of a new model which will be enhanced with the new materials that you've gathered since training the first model.  Of course, you'll want to test and compare both models to check that you have in fact enhanced performance as you were expecting.  This type of maintenance and update to the model will be required to any and all of these types of systems as they're currently designed as the structure and usage of our languages evolve.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>Conclusion</b></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">OK, so not necessarily a blog post that was ever designed to draw a conclusion but I wanted to wrap up by saying that this is an area of technology that is still very much in active research and development, and has been so for at least 40-50 years or more!  There's a really interesting statistic I've seen in the field that says if you ask a range of people involved in this topic the answer to the question “when will speech to text become a reality” then the answer generally comes out at “in ten years time”.  This question has been asked consistently over time and the answer has remained the same.  It seems then, that either this is a really hard nut to crack or that our expectations of such a system move on over time.  Either way, it seems there will always be something new just around the corner to advance us to the next stage of speech technologies.</div>					</div><!-- .entry-content -->

Of course, there was the obligatory wining and dining in the evening which just went to make the experience all the more pleasurable.<br /><br />I really hope to be able to talk a lot more about things we're doing with the university in the future. &nbsp;Until then, I'm looking forward to going back a little more often and potentially imparting some words (of wisdom?) to some students too.					</div><!-- .entry-content -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p style="text-align: left;">Back in 2007, <a title="My new friend blog post" href="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/2007/05/24/my-new-friend/" >my Mum and I got a pair of Internet-connected Nabaztag bunnies</a>. Aside from all the online content we could subscribe to using the bunnies, the most fun thing for me was that we could &#8216;pair&#8217; our bunnies so that they would talk to each other. If I moved the ears on my bunny, the ears on my Mum&#8217;s bunny would move to match, and vice versa. The 250 physical miles disappear for a few seconds when you see the ears move and know that it&#8217;s because Mum is physically moving the ears of her bunny. I know exactly what she&#8217;s doing at that particular pointing in time, as if we&#8217;re briefly in the same room. The technical term for this is, apparently, <a title="Ambient awareness on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_awareness" ><em>ambient awareness</em></a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2013" style="width: 225px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2013" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/bunny-225x300.jpg" alt="My Nabaztag bunny" width="225" height="300" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">My Nabaztag bunny</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">The bunny ears experience of ambient awareness inspired my first (and, so far, only) Arduino project: <a title="Electricity monitoring with Christmas lights and Arduino" href="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/2010/02/09/electricity-monitoring-with-christmas-lights-and-arduino/" >Monitoring electricity using Christmas lights</a>. The red/orange lights indicated the current electricity usage of my house and the blue/green lights indicated the current electricity usage of Mum and Dad&#8217;s house. The more electricity currently being used, the faster the lights flashed. Again, it was just that tiny tiny insight into what was happening 250 miles away. Just the mundanity of everyday life shared.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So I was curious about the <a title="Kickstarter project for Good Night Lamp" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/designswarm/good-night-lamp/" >Kickstarter project</a> for the <a title="Good Night Lamp website" href="http://goodnightlamp.com/" >Good Night Lamp</a>. The Good Night Lamp is a really nice and simple concept. One person has a Big Lamp (shaped like a  house) and they give Little Lamps, associated with the Big Lamp, to friends and/or family anywhere in the world. When the owner switches off the Big Lamp (when they go out or go to bed), the associated Little Lamps also switch off. An appealing part of it is that you can collect a Little Lamp from each of your family or group of friends and arrange them on a shelf so that before you go to bed at night, you can see each of them &#8216;say goodnight&#8217; as their respective lights go out.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2012" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2012 size-medium" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Good-Night-Lamp-9-300x200.jpg" alt="Good-Night-Lamp-9" width="300" height="200" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Good Night Lamp</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">The problem I see with the Good Night Lamp is similar to the one with the Nabaztag. While I think it&#8217;s great having simple devices that do just one thing well, it doesn&#8217;t half clutter up the place. These kinds of devices need shelf-space. And it has to be shelf-space you can see easily in a place you&#8217;ll often be or they don&#8217;t work. Maybe as people replace all their books with the more easily stored ebooks, living-room bookcases will become filled with ambient devices instead. I got to chatting with <a title="Ambient Orb website" href="http://www.ambientdevices.com/about/consumer-devices" >Ambient Orb</a> fan <a title="@andysc on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/andysc" >Andy Stanford-Clark</a> about it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While my and my Mum&#8217;s&#8217; Nabaztags have now died or gone into hibernation and the Christmas lights never made it as far as the tree, our more lasting providers of ambient awareness don&#8217;t even have their own physical forms. Instead, they&#8217;re software on our smartphones and tablets, devices that we have around anyway, wherever we are. In particular, SMS updates of my Mum and Dad&#8217;s Tweets.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Every morning, my Mum wakes up, has a coffee with my Dad, and reads interesting articles on her iPad. I know this from when I&#8217;ve visited them and because when she reads an interesting article, she tweets or retweets it and I receive about half-a-dozen txts in quick succession. Later in the afternoon, after they&#8217;ve got home from wherever they&#8217;ve been that day (or have found free wifi somewhere while they&#8217;re out) and are drinking another cup of coffee or tea, I receive another half-a-dozen txts pointing to interesting articles online. Just receiving the txts gives me an awareness of them waking up or sitting down to read the paper. Clicking the links to the articles gives me an insight into what they&#8217;re reading and how they&#8217;re probably feeling about the topics of the articles. The fairly mundane, everyday things that we wouldn&#8217;t remember, or bother, to talk about on the phone a week or so later.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As drinking coffee or tea seems to play a regular, if side, part in the activities I&#8217;m notified about, Andy and I came up with the idea of the Ambient Kettle. In my house, we have a whole house <a title="Current Cost website" href="http://currentcost.co.uk/" >Current Cost monitor</a> that is connected to a server out on the Internet. It was the feed from this server that we used in my Christmas Lights project. Since then, though, I&#8217;ve added individual appliance monitors (IAMs) to a few of the appliances around the house, including the kettle. The feeds from these IAMs also go to the server and so can be used by applications that know which data to request.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So Andy hacked up a (private) Twitter account, @ambientkettle, which my Mum follows. Each time the kettle boils in my house, the @ambientkettle account tweets to my Mum:</p>
<figure id="attachment_2011" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2011" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/kettle-tweet-300x77.png" alt="@ambientkettle tweets" width="300" height="77" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">@ambientkettle tweets</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Without being physically present or explicitly letting her know that I am making a cup of tea, she can get a sense of what I&#8217;m doing. The messages in the tweets that @ambientkettle sends are pre-canned and chosen at random but made to be chatty enough that it seems a bit like the start of a conversation. Indeed, Mum sometimes tweets back to it to say that she and Dad are also having a cup of tea or are looking forward to one when they get home, or whatever. As I say, it&#8217;s mundane but it&#8217;s those kinds of mundane things that make everyday life.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ll be interested to see how the Good Night Lamp gets taken up. It was featured in the very mainstream <a title="@GNLteam's tweet about Daily Mail article" href="https://twitter.com/GNLteam/status/312626544336064512" >Daily Mail yesterday</a> and <a title="Good Night Lamp team" href="http://goodnightlamp.com/team/" >its founding team</a> has a good record of startups, product design, interaction design, and Internet of Things creativeness. And there&#8217;s something very appealing about having ambient awareness of friends and family when we&#8217;re geographically spread apart.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>At the end of January I was lucky enough to be given a ticket to a two day long software development conference called “Monki Gras” (named after the company that runs the event, Red Monk) in London.</p>
<p>The theme of the conference was “scaling craft”, a pretty ambiguous theme which over the next two days was nicely pinned down by the wide variety of speakers. This theme was roughly translated into answering the question: “how do we maintain quality when scaling up to mass production?”.</p>
<p>Some of the speakers invited included, most importantly, Phil Gilbert of <a href="mailto:Design@IBM">Design@IBM</a> fame, who discussed how he is trying to bring a culture of design into the company, and to name a few more: Rafe Colburn from Etsy, Chris Aniszczyk from Twitter, Shanley Kane from Basho, Steven Citron-Pousty from Redhat and Ted Nyman from Github.</p>
<p>The conference was more than just good speakers. Fantastic food (specifically Japanese and Vietnamese) was provided on both days for lunch, along with some craft beers; coffee was available all day from an artisan coffee company, and the evening entertainment was hosted at London Fields Brewery where we were given a five course meal cooked by a top London based street kitchen. Quality was a theme in every aspect of the conference that mattered, whereas the hall where most of the talks were given was quite plain and basic, but all attention was on the speakers.</p>
<p>The first question that was addressed by the speakers was that of “What is craft?”. Rafe Colburn did a great job of opening the conference by discussing the common misconceptions associated with “hand crafted treasures compared to mass produced crap”. Not everything that is made at home is high quality, and not everything that is massed produced is is low quality. There are benefits to both – craft maximises the skill and creativity of the individual artisan and mass production optimizes predictability and repeatability.</p>
<p>Other speakers approached this topic too: Chris Thorpe has set up a company called The Flexiscale Company where he uses 3D-scanning technology to scan rare train engines so they can be forever preserved in their current state. Using these scans he is then able to 3D-print accurate models of the trains to any scale a model train enthusiast would desire. I personally have never seen the attraction to model trains, but his talk was one of the highlights of the conference as it honestly and unintentionally captured something really special about craft – the unashamed enthusiasm and passion for what you do. This same enthusiasm was displayed in the talk given by Diane Mueller (ActiveState) about a personal project to geotag Totem Poles in the Pacific Northwest (at the end of her talk she invited anyone interested to join her in tagging the totem pole in Virginia Waters). Manufacturers were given a good slogan for this mentality by Chris: “Make things people want, rather than make people want things”.</p>
<p>So how does a software company maintain this sense of passion, and craftsmanship, when it is scaled up to a company the size of IBM? Phil Gilbert&#8217;s talk was centred around design, but he touched on this idea when he asserted that developers can lose sight of the value, and ultimately the end result, when they only work on a small part of a huge product (and as part of a small team within Message Broker development I sympathise). His solution was something known as “Commander&#8217;s Intent”, the idea that in battle all soldiers are briefed on the overall goal of the mission before they are in the chaos of the battlefield. When they then enter the battlefield no further orders are given; it is the responsibility of the commander to ensure that everyone has understood their goal and how to reach it so they are able to make informed decisions themselves rather than have minute details dictated at every move.</p>
<p>To apply this to software development Phil suggests appointing someone to own the decision making process, and a trusted community of people reviewing (but not dictating) outcomes. But most of all, ensure that your staff prepare for (great) outcomes and understand the value of what they are working on. Cyndi Mitchell from ThoughtWorks expanded on this, adding an analogy from her experiences growing up on a hog farm (where the product is the hogs and the developers are the farmers), in particular she stated that “everyone in the system has to understand quality”.</p>
<p>In the most extreme example of this, Ted Nyman from Github discussed how their organisation has no managers. In response to this every employee must have a sense of ownership, and if this is effective everything the employee needs to get done will get done.</p>
<p>Although the conference was a technical one, it became clear that software development was only the medium in which people were discussing their ideas. Instead the conference was really about culture, and on this topic there was a lot of food for thought. In Heroku, a platform as a service company, the number of deploys a day are in the high hundreds. “Move fast and break [stuff]” was the (family friendly version of the) mantra for their organisation, and this was only possible if developers&#8217; time became sacred. They introduced the headphone rule: headphones on means &#8216;do not disturb&#8217;, and the fantastic piece of advice “work in caves, dwell in commons”. This demonstrates the flip side to protecting developers time: when you&#8217;re not working, communicate! Coffee breaks become an important part of the working life (hence the title of their presentation “Coffee as collaboration”) as this is when ideas can be shared and discussed. Taking time to document your work to get the recognition you deserve and killing off projects that aren&#8217;t working can only happen if communication is just as important as the development.</p>
<p>This protection of the developer was also discussed by Rafe Colburn, whose advice for companies looking to scale was to automate everything that could be automated, leaving time for developers to work on their beloved craft. Phil Gilbert suggests using release hills with clear goals (three maximum) so that people can reclaim their craft, but also building in regular iterations of design and innovation to keep the craft fresh.</p>
<p>On the topic of iterations, Government Digital Services (GDS) discussed how in the space of two years they scaled their team from a handful of people to 200 employees. They attributed their success to constant iterations of processes, tools and people, avoiding the dreaded “single point of failure”. Understanding how to effectively do this comes down to understanding your “ecosystem” (a term commonly misused), as explained by Steven Citron-Pousty. He used his background in ecology to encourage people to think about nature&#8217;s ecosystems in comparison to those in their organisation, in particular identify the keystone developers as well as the day-to-day developers, and understand the sometimes unexpected relationships between them and their colleagues.</p>
<p>Another point of discussion (initially introduced by Mazz Mosely from GDS) was the issue of “rock star” developers. These can be the aforementioned “single point of failures”, but more importantly they are those mysterious developers that the entire success of the product is pinned onto. Other than not being what they may be hyped up to be, rock stars can also be disruptive to teams &#8211; feeling that only their opinions count and not using the shared knowledge of their colleagues. A better approach is to cultivate an environment where everyone is respectful and understands that the “users” of your product are not just the end-users, but also your colleagues.</p>
<p>In summary (some takeaway coffee if you will), culture is one of the most important aspects of a company. Culture, as asserted by Shanley Kane and Ted Nyman, is not the furniture in your office or the perks your company offers, but it is what eventually picks between two good ideas. With this in mind, it becomes increasingly important that the whole organisation has the same mentality behind their work. As software engineers we like to think of ourselves as craftspeople, and can easily become frustrated if our work becomes mindless, so how can we avoid this happening? Here are some top tips to avoid this kind of disappointment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teams should be honest about what they can achieve in an iteration, at the risk of losing faith in the product and only completing the easy tasks just to tick them off a list,</li>
<li>expect, encourage and respect feedback from your colleagues</li>
<li>and understand the quality and value of what they are working on.</li>

			<p style="text-align: left;">The work of <a title="William Morris in Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morris" >William Morris</a>, my <a title="GCSE on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education" >GCSE</a> history teacher said, was a bit of a moral dilemma. Morris was a British designer born during the <a title="The Industrial Revolution on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" >Industrial Revolution</a>. British (and then world) industry was moving rapidly towards mass production by replacing traditional, cottage-industry production processes with the more efficient, and therefore profitable, machines. One thing that suffered under this move to mass production was the focus on function and quantity over decoration and quality. Morris reacted against this by designing and producing decorations like wallpaper and textiles using the traditional craft techniques of skilled craftspeople. My history teacher&#8217;s point was that although Morris, a passionate socialist, was able to create high quality goods by using smaller-scale production methods, only wealthy people could afford to buy his designs; which was hardly equality in action. On the other hand, the skills of craftspeople were being retained, quality goods were being produced, and the craftspeople were getting paid for that quality of their work.</p>

<p><a title="Monkigras website" href="http://monkigras.com/" >Monkigras 2013</a>, in London last week, took on this theme of &#8216;scaling craft&#8217; in the context of beer, coffee, and software. All parts of this trinity of software development can benefit hugely from a focus on quality over quantity. Before I went to Monkigras, I wasn&#8217;t really sure what to expect from a tech event advertised as having a lot of beer. It did have a lot of beer (and coffee) available but if you didn&#8217;t want it you could avoid it (several people I talked to said they didn&#8217;t usually drink beer). And no one seemed to get ridiculously drunk. And there were a lot of very cool talks.</p>
<p>The beer was also a fun analogy to apply to software development. Despite <a title="Closed pubs project website" href="http://www.closedpubs.co.uk/" >pubs in the UK closing hand over fist</a> at the moment, microbreweries are on the rise. <a title="Microbreweries on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbrewing" >Microbrewing</a> is about producing beer in small quantities on a commercial basis so that quality can be maintained whilst still viable as a business. One of the things we learnt from a brewer at Monkigras is that the taste of water varies according to where it comes from. Water is a major component of beer so if the taste of your water supply changes, the taste of your beer changes. To maintain the quality of the beer you brew, you must work within the natural resources available to you and not over-expand. Similarly, quality comes from skilled and knowledgeable people who need to be paid for their skill. If you take on cheaper staff and train them less so that you can make more profit, you will end up with a poorer quality product. You get the idea.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1526" style="width: 179px;" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1526" src="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-01-15.32.42-179x300.jpg" alt="Handcrafting a wooden spoon." width="179" height="300" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Handcrafting a wooden spoon.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This principle applies to all areas of craft, whether it&#8217;s producing quality coffee, a quality wooden spoon, quality conference food, or organising a quality conference, you have to focus on quality and ensure that if you scale what you do so that it&#8217;s more readily available to more people, you don&#8217;t sacrifice quality at the same time. And, importantly, that you know when to stop. Bigger doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean better.</p>
<p>Software is misleadingly easy to produce. Unlike making physical objects, there is very little initial cost to producing software; you can make copies and then distribute them to customers over the Internet at very little cost. Initially, at least, it&#8217;s all in the skill of the craftspeople and their ability to identify their target users and market. If they can&#8217;t make what people will buy, they will go out of business very quickly. As software development companies get larger, the people who make the software inside the company become further removed from the selling of their software to their customers. So they become more focused on what they are close to, the technology but not who will use it.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1535" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1535" src="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_1074-300x196.jpg" alt="Phil Gilbert on IBM Design Thinking" width="300" height="196" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Phil Gilbert on IBM Design Thinking</figcaption></figure>
<p><a title="Phil Gilbert on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/philgilbertsr" >Phil Gilbert</a>, IBM&#8217;s new General Manager of Design, comes from a 30-year career in startups, most recently <a title="Lombardi acquisition press release" href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/28890.wss" >Lombardi</a>, where design was core to their culture. IBM has a portfolio of 3000 software products so, when Lombardi was acquired by IBM, Phil set about simplifying the <a title="IBM BPM product page" href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/business-process-manager/" >IBM Business Process Management</a> portfolio of products, reducing 21 different products to just four and kicking off a cultural change to bring design and thinking about users to the centre of product development. Whilst praising IBM&#8217;s history of design and a recent server product design award, he also acknowledged at Monkigras: &#8220;We are rethinking everything at IBM. Our portfolio is a mess today and we need to get better&#8221;. Changing a culture like IBM&#8217;s isn&#8217;t easy but I&#8217;ve seen and experienced a big difference already. Phil&#8217;s challenge is to scale the high-quality user-focused design values of a startup to a <a title="IBM100 website" href="http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/" >century-old</a> global corporation.</p>
<p>One of the things that struck me most at Monkigras, and appealed to me most as a social scientist, was the focus on the human side. Despite it being a developer conference, I remember seeing only one slide that contained code. The overriding theme was about people and culture, not technology; how to maintain quality by maintaining a culture that respects its craftspeople and how to retain both even if the organisation gets bigger, even if that naturally limits how much the organisation can grow. Personal analogy was also a big thing&#8230;</p>
<figure id="attachment_1536" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1536" src="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_1076-cropped-300x218.jpg" alt="Laser-scanned model of the engine" width="300" height="218" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Laser-scanned model of the engine</figcaption></figure>
<p><a title="Cyndi on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/mitchellcyndi" >Cyndi Mitchell</a> from Logspace talked about her family&#8217;s hog farm and working within the available resources. <a title="Shanley on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/shanley" >Shanley Kane</a> from Basho used Dante&#8217;s spheres to describe best product management practices. <a title="Steve on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/TheSteve0" >Steve Citron-Pousty</a> from RedHat use his background as an ecologist to manage communities and &#8216;developer ecosystems&#8217; (don&#8217;t just call it an ecosystem; treat it like one). <a title="Diane on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/pythondj" >Diane Mueller</a> from ActiveState talked about her 20%-time project to build a crowdsourced database of totem poles and the challenges of understanding what gets people to want to contribute to such projects. <a title="Elco on Twitter" href="http://www.elcojacobs.com/" >Elco Jacobs</a> talked about his BrewPi project: automatically managing the temperature of his homebrewing fridge using a RaspberryPi based controller, and how he has open-sourced to build a community to kick start it as a potential small business. <a title="Rafe on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/rafeco" >Rafe Colburn</a> from Etsy more directly makes the link between craft and software engineering in <a title="Rafe's slides" href="https://speakerdeck.com/rafeco/artisinal-software-manufacturing" >his slides</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1532" style="width: 179px;" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1532" src="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-01-15.35.52-179x300.jpg" alt="3D printer making a spoon" width="179" height="300" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">3D printer making a spoon</figcaption></figure>
<p>I don&#8217;t know much about William Morris so I don&#8217;t know which presentations he would have enjoyed or disagreed with. Morris was a preservationist and started the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings to ensure that old buildings get repaired and not restored to an arbitrary point in the past. So maybe he would have found laser-scanning and <a title="3D printing on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3d_printing" >3D printing</a> interesting. <a title="Chris on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/jaggeree" >Chris Thorpe</a> is a model train geek and likes to hand-make his own models of real-life objects. He too is interested in alternatives to mass manufacturing and has started to look at how to make model kits. He uses a laser to scan the objects and a 3D printer to prototype the models. He can then send the model to a commercial company who can make it into kits for him to sell. He has recently used his laser-scanning technique to scan a rediscovered old Welsh railway engine to preserve it, virtually at least, in the state in which it was found.</p>
<p>I had a great time with lots of cool and fun people. Well done to <a title="@monkchips on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/monkchips" >@monkchips</a> for scaling a conference to just the right level of intimacy and buzz. The last thing I saw before I left was the craftsman making a wooden spoon pitted in competition against the 3D printer making a plastic spoon.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Spurred on by the success of <a href="http://jtlog.wordpress.com/2013/01/04/raspberry-pi-mosquitto/">getting Mosquitto working on a Raspberry Pi</a>, I recently had a play with MQTT on the Joggler. The <a href="http://www.jogglerwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page">O2 Joggler is still a great device for hacking</a> and I currently have <a href="http://birdslikewires.co.uk/articles/squeezeplay-os">SqeezePlay OS</a> running on it.</p>
<p>The reason I wanted to try and get MQTT on the Joggler was to make use of its light sensor, and publish light levels over MQTT. It all turned out to be pretty simple since most of the work has already been done by other people!</p>
<ul>
<li>Andrew de Quincey has <a href="http://code.google.com/p/adqmisc/source/browse/trunk/joggler/readlightsensor.c">code to read the Joggler&#8217;s light sensor</a></li>
<li>Andy Piper has a <a href="http://andypiper.co.uk/2012/03/10/paho-gets-started/">handy quick start guide for Paho</a></li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/paho/files/mqttdoc/Cclient/">MQTT C client documentation</a> has simple publish examples</li>
</ul>
<p>First thing to do was read the light sensor and get that working with an MQTT client. I had to skip some of Andy&#8217;s instructions and just built the client code rather than attempting to get doxygen working. Once I&#8217;d mashed up the light sensor code and publish example I could compile the worlds most pointless MQTT publisher:</p>
<pre>gcc -Wall publightsensor.c -L../bin/linux_ia32 -I../src -lmqttv3c -lpthread -o publightsensor</pre>
<p>Next it was time to check the results. This too was quick and easy thanks to the <a href="http://m2m.eclipse.org/sandbox.html">MQTT sandbox server</a>, which has a handy HTTP bridge. And the final result... was a completely unscientific and <a href="http://m2m-eclipse.cloudfoundry.com/jttest">slightly dingy light level 4</a>! Now I'll be able to turn on a lamp using an unreliable RF controlled socket and see whether it worked or not!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> the code really is all in the existing examples but I've created a Github Gist in case it's any help: <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4753409">mqttjogglermashup.c</a> (11 February 2013)</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/jtlog.wordpress.com/2171/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/jtlog.wordpress.com/2171/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=jtlog.wordpress.com&#038;blog=1751515&%23038;post=2171&%23038;subd=jtlog&%23038;ref=&%23038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />					</div><!-- .entry-content -->

			<p>This afternoon I went to <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/everybody-technology">Everybody Technology</a>, an event to discuss the need for technology to be inclusive and made in a way that is &#8220;so smart, so simple and so powerful it works for everybody&#8221;. </p>
<p>A highlight of the afternoon was Stephen Hawking &#8211; perhaps one of the best examples of the power of technology to enable someone to reach their potential. He also supported the event by lending his voice to <a href="http://youtu.be/2Tel9UvJfws?hd=1">a promotional video</a> which explains the idea better than I can.</p>
<p><iframe width="450" height="253" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/2Tel9UvJfws?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<small><a href="http://youtu.be/2Tel9UvJfws?hd=1">&#8220;Who is Technology Made For?&#8221; (YouTube)</a></small></p>
<p>There were several speakers. I won&#8217;t do them justice, but I did jot a few notes&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Panel discussion with <a href="http://twitter.com/rupertg">Rupert Goodwins</a> (ZDNet UK) &#038; <a href="http://twitter.com/damonrose">Damon Rose</a> (BBC)</strong></p>
<p>They talked of the stigma of using &#8220;special&#8221; equipment created especially for the blind. There were examples where even when technology or tools exist that can help, people don&#8217;t always want to use them. Maybe because they feel embarrassed, or they don&#8217;t want to be different, or even that they&#8217;re struggling with feeling forced to join a group of people they don&#8217;t feel a part of. </p>
<p>They discussed how it was more acceptable to use technologies when they are &#8220;standard&#8221; and how some felt more comfortable using technology that doesn&#8217;t single them out as being different. </p>
<p>Someone noted how people can be embarrassed wearing a hearing aid to help them hear, whilst few people would be embarrassed to wear glasses to help them see. Why are some assistive technologies more culturally acceptable than others?</p>
<p>There was a lot of mention of iDevices and appreciation of assistive technology being delivered as iPhone apps. To everyone else, it&#8217;s an iPhone and doesn&#8217;t stand out as being different. In addition, the fact that it&#8217;s mass-manufactured has meant that an expensive collection of advanced sensors and processing capability can be made affordable. An equivalent device produced purely as an assistive technology would be prohibitively expensive. The iPhone sparked a smartphone revolution that made this technology affordable in a way that it wasn&#8217;t before.</p>
<p>There was also discussion about how the app culture removed barriers between potential users and developers.  Affordable sensors and technology made widely available, combined with a low-cost delivery mechanism for software innovations, make possible innovations in assistive technology that would have been impossible a few years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation on accessible architecture by <a href="http://www.fosterandpartners.com/Team/SeniorPartners/23/Default.aspx">Paul Kalkhoven</a></strong></p>
<p>This looked at parallels between buildings and software. Disability became accepted as important in architecture and you can&#8217;t build a new building without considering accessibility. This isn&#8217;t yet true of technology. </p>
<p>He talked of the conflicting interests of design and utility. When designing a building, you want it to be unique and different. However, you want it to be obvious. If you want to find a toilet or fire exit, you want to understand the layout immediately. The same applies to technology: we want to make something new and exciting. But there is an expectation that it should be usable without a manual. It needs to be accessible. </p>
<p>One observation I hadn&#8217;t really recognised: transport buildings lead the way for accessible architecture, often abiding by a common, albeit unwritten, set of standards. </p>
<p>He challenged us to consider what technologists could learn from their experience. </p>
<p><strong>Presentation on talking TVs by Mark Vasey (Panasonic)</strong></p>
<p>Voice guidance is included as standard in most new Panasonic TVs, offering text-to-speech guidance for complex TV menus. </p>
<p>Perhaps more interesting was how they made it happen. He talked about challenges such as the cost of development, licensing and royalties for a feature they include &#8220;for free&#8221;. There were challenges in marketing to a minority, without wanting to classify it as a specialist product, and without making sighted users think that they were paying for a feature they didn&#8217;t need or want. </p>
<p>Similar to the discussion of the iPhone&#8217;s impact, he explained how the only way they could do this and make it affordable was to make it standard. Making a specialist TV with accessibility features for the visually impaired would not have been affordable. Spreading the cost across their entire product line is what made it possible. </p>

<p><strong>Presentation on Threedom Phone &#8211; <a href="http://twitter.com/ribotmaximus">Antony Ribot</a> (Ribot)</strong></p>
<p>Antony gave a thought-provoking presentation about their project to make <a href="http://threedomphone.com/">the world&#8217;s simplest smartphone</a>. </p>
<p>The smartphone revolution has been great for many, but isn&#8217;t suitable for everyone. For some, the controls are too small, or too fiddly, or just too complicated. What if we made a smartphone that had only three buttons? Could we provide the essential functions that people need on a device with three large, easy to press, easy to understand, buttons? </p>
<p>He had <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=287120271315899&#038;set=a.218094251551835.69931.191471250880802">an example with him</a> and made a convincing case that there is a need for a device like this, in a market where devices are racing to get more complicated. </p>
<p><strong>Everybody Technology : <a href="http://rlsb.org.uk/everybody">rlsb.org.uk/everybody</a></strong></p>
<p>A year ago, I <a href="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=1858">wrote about RLSB&#8217;s event</a> which brought together a handful of representatives from tech companies, consumer-facing businesses, Universities, and charities for the blind. We talked about a vision of a Conversational Internet. </p>
<p>A year later, and RLSB got together a couple of hundred people to talk about projects that had happened &#8211; both by them, such as <a href="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=2346">the Conversational Internet prototype that I presented</a>, and by others such as Panasonic&#8217;s collaboration with <a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/">RNIB</a> to produce Voice Guidance. </p>
<p>They talked about what comes next, <a href="http://www.rlsb.org.uk/get-involved/everybody-technology-new/etnetwork/">establishing a new group</a> to bring together technologists and designers with people who understand disabilities, to make real their vision where everyone is taken into consideration. </p>
<p>If you think this is something you can help with, either as a developer, designer, or someone who understands a disability, then why not <a href="http://rlsb.org.uk/everybody">join them</a>. </p>

<p>This week I had a day out of the office to go to Zurich to talk at this years IBM developerWorks Days. I had 2 sessions back to back in the mobile stream, the first an introduction to Android Development and the second on MQTT.</p>
<p>The slots were only 35mins long (well 45mins, but we had to leave 5 mins on each end to let people move round) so there was a limit to how much detail I could go into. With this in mind I decided the best way to give people a introduction to Android Development in that amount of time was to quickly walk through writing reasonably simple application. The application had to be at least somewhat practical, but also very simple so after a little bit of thinking about I settled on an app to download the latest image from the web comic <a href="http://xkcd.org/">XKCD</a>. There are a number apps on Google Play that already do this (and a lot better) but it does show a little Activity GUI design. I got through about 95% of the app live on stage and only had to copy &#038; paste the details for the onPostExecute method to clear the progress dialog and update the image in the last minute to get it to the point I could run it in the emulator.</p>
<p>Here are the slides for this session</p>

<p>And here is the Eclipse project for the Application I created live on stage:<br />
<a href="http://www.hardill.me.uk/XKCD-demo-android-app.zip">http://www.hardill.me.uk/XKCD-demo-android-app.zip</a></p>
<p>The MQTT pitch was a little easier to set up, there is loads of great content on <a href="http://mqtt.org/">MQTT.org</a> to use as a source and of course I remembered to include the section on the MQTT enabled mouse traps and twittering ferries from <a href="http://twitter.com/andysc">Andy Stanford-Clark</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the slides for the MQTT session:</p>

<p>For the Demo I used the Javascript d3 topic tree viewer I <a href="http://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/?p=1111" title="d3 MQTT topic tree visualiser">blogged about</a> last week and my Raspberry Pi running a <a href="http://mosquitto.org/">Mosquitto</a> broker and a little script to publish the core temperature, load and uptime values. The broker was also bridged to my home broker to show the feed from my weather centre and some other sensors.</p>

<h2>An introduction for those not familiar with the Pi &#8230;</h2>
<p>Yesterday Eben Upton (the guy behind the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a> foundation) took time out of his very busy schedule to give a talk in Hursley. For those who are not familiar with it, the Raspberry Pi (<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs">here is the FAQ</a>) is basically a small credit-card sized computer circuit board with a Broadcom BCM2835 chipset and a 700MHz ARM CPU powered via a microUSB socket, HDMI+composite video output, stereo audio output, ethernet port, 2 USB ports, an SD slot used for booting the device, and another proprietary expansion port, and a high performance graphics subsystem that can decode video at full HD resolution with h.264 (<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1839">MPEG-2 available at extra cost</a>) hardware playback support in XBMC/OpenElec &#8211; all for $35 for the &#8220;model B&#8221; version. They were initially built in China, but much of the manufacturing is now <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1925">in the UK</a> and is therefore supporting the UK economy! Keyboard/mouse/power/screen/SD card are not included in that price, but many people will have suitable ones lying around to connect to it, which certainly suited me as the last thing I need is more of them cluttering the place up.</p>
<p>As someone who was interested in the project from some time prior to the launch it was great to see Eben in person, particularly as I&#8217;m someone who owned a BBC Micro and lost many hours to Elite (co-written by David Braben, who is also involved in the project). If that though is making any of you feel nostalgic, why not try the ZX Spectrum port of <a href="http://www.twinbee.org/hob/play.php?snap=elite">Elite running in a java applet</a>!) The Pi as a project is trying to bring back a bit of that sense of &#8220;playing&#8221; that the BBC Micro probably did better than any other machine of its time.</p>
<p>(Quick disclaimer: This article is a mix of things that Eben spoke about from the notes I took, plus a few extra pieces of background information and external links that I have added myself)</p>
<p>The detailed background to the original idea was something I had not heard in detail before. A director of studies at St.John&#8217;s college in Cambridge, he was concerned by the declining numbers of applicants for computing university positions, as well as a drop in the quality of those applicants (basically changing from getting many people of the type who could likely already code in assembler for two different architectures to a smaller number who&#8217;s experience predominantly &#8220;I know HTML&#8221; &#8211; people who would need more time spent educating them to get to a suitable standard to teach them further) This meant that it would take longer to get them to an adequate standard on the low level aspects of computing &#8211; or by throwing them at Standard ML programming for 6 weeks to make them depressed (I remember going through that!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>BBC Micro comparisons</h2>
<p>I mentioned the BBC Micro in the opening paragraphs &#8211; earlier this year there was a &#8220;<a href="http://beeb30.havnet.positive-internet.com/">Beeb@30</a>&#8221; event to celebrate 30 years of that machine, and here is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15969065">a BBC article looking back on it</a>. It hass been well documented that they did try to get the BBC branding on the device, but the &#8220;unique way the BBC is funded&#8221; means that it was nowhere near as easy for the BBC to support such a commercially available device as happened in the 1980s. Having said that, the ARM-designed processor used in the Pi (and probably, your mobile/cell phone) had is roots in Acorn (<a href="http://www.arm.com/about/company-profile/milestones.php">here is a brief history of ARM</a>) who built the BBC Micro. And there is a &#8211; possibly somewhat indulgent &#8211; project to port RISCOS (the OS designed for the BBC Micro&#8217;s successor &#8211; the Archimedes) to the Pi.</p>
<p>The other thing of note on the Pi is the <a href="http://www.panu.it/raspberry/">GPIO port</a>. Now one of the things that made the BBC Micro special was the inclusion of easy I/O on the device, through the &#8220;user port&#8221; and &#8220;parallel port&#8221;. In fact even the &#8220;joystick&#8221; port was marked as an &#8220;analogue in&#8221; to plant the suggestion it&#8217;s use could extend far beyond games. This allowed a good quality of control of external devices and responding to inputs, something that allows many more interesting control projects to be done with it. At school I did a prototype satellite tracking system using it! But I digress, the GPIO port on the Pi even looks superficially very similar to the user port on the BBC Micro. The most popular interface using it so far is the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1734">Gertboard</a>. (I wish a could remember the name of the blue boards we used on the BBC Micro &#8211; anyone know?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A squashed marketplace</h2>
<p>Another good point raised by Eben was about where the previous marketplace for the BBC Micro and comparable machine has now in modern times. With the home computers of the 80s you powered them on and you got a command prompt for a programming language interpreter that almost begged you to start programming straight away &#8211; almost as though, as Eben said, you had to actively choose not to program! It was easy for anyone to go into their local computer store and make them display scrolling rude messages up the screen, and anyone owning one of those computers would have almost certainly had the knowledge to do so!</p>
<p>Nowadays it is less easy. Games consoles have taken over the high performance graphics market, with high barriers to development entry. It a similar story for the consumer tablets on the market at present &#8211; from a practical perspective the development needs to be done in another environment rather than on the device itself. Even most consumer PCs do not ship with any reasonable programming language out of the box. While that is less of an issue in the high download speed internet of today, during the 90s it took real will and effort to be able to program. The concept of having to choose not to program got completely lost. And that is some of the spirit that the Raspberry Pi is now trying to recreate. It does appear to be a bit of a gap in the market, even ignoring the Cambridge admission quality problem. There are real low-level boards around, but not so much of an all-in-one device like the Pi. And one interesting thought was that the aforementioned relatively simple <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">bloat-free</span> non-content-enriched RISCOS with the ease of switching to a traditional command line from the desktop, could rekindle some of the mentality from the 80s home computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Interest and getting to market</h2>
<p>The amount of early interest in the Pi took the foundation by surprise &#8211; 600,000 views on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/correspondents/rorycellanjones/">Rory Cellan-Jones</a> (BBC Tech correspondent) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ7N4rycsy4"> brief video with Braben</a> &#8211; could that really be an indication of how big the market was for such a device? And could they deliver that many at the target price point, which was pretty much set at $25 from the start (At the time of writing only the $35 model B mentioned in the first paragraph &#8211; which includes a 100Mbit ethernet port, 2 USB ports instead of one and the 512Mb upgrade recently announced &#8211; is shipping). But the foundation has kept to the target price point for the units, and the 512Mb upgrade for the model B has not resulted in a price change. The other remarkable thing was the number of downloads &#8211; in the tens of thousands &#8211; of the SD-card operating system image for the Pi that was released some time before the device was even on sale, so no-one could use it!</p>
<p>The vendor partnerships with Farnell/Element14 and RS were important as it allowed them to move from being a risk-averse charity to more of an IP licensing company to get the number of units they were going to need. And it was a good decision. The first day on sale, as those like me who were up at 6am to order will be aware, was a bit of a disaster (and I <a href="http://goo.gl/Id4dW">blogged to vent my frustration</a> at the time, questioning the motives of many of those buying and how it was pitched by some parts of the media). 100,000 orders were placed by the lucky people who even managed to get to the manufacturing partners (Farnell/Element14 and RS) websites. Both crashed badly under the load, preventing people from buying their resistors or other electronics from those suppliers, not just Pis! A lesson in robust scalable web sites for those two companies.</p>
<p>Another interesting point for those who have been interested in the Pi is that although most of them used in relatively rich countries such as the UK and will therefore make use of the on-board HDMI output (HDMI-DVI-D adapters can be had for under £2 on ebay if needed &#8211; make sure you get male/female as required for your setup!), the Pi also has a composite analogue video output. For me, this is convenient as it allows me to attach it to my in-car screen, but as Eben pointed out it also allows it to be sold in much poorer/emerging countries in the world, where second hand analogue TVs are still in use, and the Pi can give them a new lease of life for a price point far less than, for example, a tablet.</p>
<p>So it was good to have the talk from Eben, and I chatted to him about some other things afterwards. Fantastic to get his time, and of course this blog has been written in a browser running on one of my Pis 🙂</p>
