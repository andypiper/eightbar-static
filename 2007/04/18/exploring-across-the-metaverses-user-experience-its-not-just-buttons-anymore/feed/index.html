		<description><![CDATA[I have no doubt the bouncing penguins will have no problem with multiple metaverses. Maybe I should not worry about the huge set of people who still worry abour web 1.0/web2.0 however, I would like to bring these people with us wherever we are going. 
I am not sure whether we are all ludic users or not. Business is itself a game though I accept that &quot;serious&quot; user may not realize they are playing anyway.
Is it self deception in western culture that says serious business is not play?]]></description>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&gt; I am sure it will soon get to the stage that not only are there more islands in Second Life than you can keep up with, that there are more metaverse instances than you can keep up with.</p>
<p>I think it’s been that way for years. </p>
<p>&gt;So the question is. Do we attempt to ensure people get a first experience on their first metaverse that is positive, and if so by who’s standards? Or, just let it sort it self out.</p>
<p>Depends who. Primacy seems more important than Recency for what we might call the first generation of metaverse users. Bartle has talked about the way cultures move across virtual worlds through tribes of Beta users who’s expectations are imprinted by their first world. For business / non-primarily ludic users this initial imprint is really important, it forms the way you frame the virtual and it does not get shaken</p>
<p>The exception is possibly those of use that surf the surface of things – I’ve regularly been in two virtual spaces at the same time on adjacent monitors (try running in opposite directions when a bit drunk, it’s a blast). </p>
<p>Though as with many things my ultimate answer is – just wait. The Club Penguin Generation as opposed to the &#8220;Tux Penguin Generation I’m sure are much more happy to bounce between penguin, im, facebook and txt. </p>
