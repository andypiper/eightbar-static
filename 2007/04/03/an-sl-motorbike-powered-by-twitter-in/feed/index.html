		<description><![CDATA[Harley has designed its year-long, ten-city 100th-anniversary bash to appeal to both the old riders it has long satisfied and the new riders it needs. On the first day of Atlanta&#039;s party, the HOG clubs were to mingle and get their first look at the anniversary models. On the weekend Harley would invite the public to its Open Road Tour, featuring country singer Tim McGraw and other draws for nonbikers. The company was hoping for daily weekend crowds of 40,000 to 50,000. But it had never staged anything like this and was counting on a whole lot of people having a whole lot of curiosity about Harley--plus a whole lot of cash to pay $55 a ticket.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wearing black leather and riding huge Harleys, a motorcycle gang thunders through northern Georgia as if en route to a rumble. But the only rumble for this gang--the Atlanta Harley Owners Group (HOG)--is the one in their stomachs. It&#039;s another Sunday ride in the country for the group, and as usual it ends with a feast. &quot;We live to ride, and we ride to eat,&quot; says club assistant director B.K. Ellis, a systems analyst.]]></description>
