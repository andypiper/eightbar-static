		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I&#8217;m working for them, and on such topics, I can tell you that it&#8217;s really what they want to achieve, and they give themselves the means to do it!</p>
<p>The presentation they gave to 400 spectators on a 400m² stereoscopic screen about the Khufu pyramid theory is a first step towards this.</p>
<p>More on this here : <a href="http://cb.nowan.net/blog/2007/03/31/the-pyramid-and-the-biggest-vr-screen/" rel="nofollow">http://cb.nowan.net/blog/2007/03/31/the-pyramid-and-the-biggest-vr-screen/</a></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Related to this, I think: There was a recent shuffle at Dassault. Founder Francis Bernard reportedly retired from the company but has since taken over the CEO position at ParallelGraphics (fwiw, for those unaware as I was, he was previously on the board, so his involvement with the company predates this move).

Now if Dassault has &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; kind of a vision (and that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a neat video) and already owns a virtual application company (Virtools), I have to ask: What does Mr. Bernard intend to do at ParallelGraphics? Worth keeping an eye on them.]]></description>
