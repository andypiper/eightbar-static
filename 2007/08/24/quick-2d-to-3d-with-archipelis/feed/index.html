		<description><![CDATA[[...] It seems to be safari week here on eightbar. The guys over at archipelis told me about their new sculpty exporter for second life. They have some sample files here. I wrote about Archipelis a little while ago as it is such a simple way to draw and create complex objects I really enjoyed using it. Now that there is the potential to create sculpties, and quite complex ones at that it has got even better. I created the rhino from the sample whilst I sort out my own models just to see it work. I think you will all agree it is very good. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@karagines I think things like pictomod are more like 3d SOM. they use reference photos in all rotations to create a model and texture it. Archipelis is more about free hand drawing and converting that to 3d. With the nice addition you can draw around and texture from a single photo]]></description>
