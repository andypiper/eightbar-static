		<description><![CDATA[We have been doing QRC work in SL for a year now, with good results. They hold up well and decode with JPhones at small sizes (see reference photos).

Note: you can make them for free from several web sites, but we charge a fee because we offer translation services, and use Japanese software for better control of encryption (like adding images).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your post was music to my ears.

The only way I can ever get anything done, is to have about 10 things I need to do at the same time. The kicker is, even with all of these things if I try and structure how much time I spend on them my first instinct it to rebel! I&#039;ve driven many a PM mad because when they were ask me how far through a list of tasks I was, most of the time all I could tell them was, &quot;don&#039;t worry, it&#039;ll all be done in time&quot;. Amazingly, most of it does get done, probably because I realise I&#039;ll get shot if I don&#039;t get the important things done in time.

I think Gladiator somes it up well:

Maximus: Do you find it difficult to do your duty? 

Cicero: Sometimes I do what I want to do. The rest of the time, I do what I have to.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent post! And to add my own experience with QR codes.

Having a working prototype of the AR Handheld device from Daniel Wagner. I thought of merging the QR code with my business card to have my SL avatar (or RL avatar) augmented on top of it (with a lot of help from the Daniel).

Though, my thesis have put that project on hold, so I must accept the default Quake II avatar in stead...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Guilty as charged  (sorry Mandy) 
The coolest thing  about this is that if you point your camera at that photo, it reads the QRcode - how recursive is that!
