		<description><![CDATA[[...] I just watched the BBC MoneyProgramme edition about virtual worlds and real money. It featured a few people we all know quite well. It being the BBC and the money programme it covered everything really well. There was still a playfulness about the piece, but it showed the seriousness of the entire industry. Philip Rosedale/Linden made some good points about the future, and how we dont quite know where its going but its going to be exciting. Max Flint also did not solely cover Second Life but instead looked at the business of virtual goods versus subscription models. It was good to see Justin Bovington on TV from Rivers Run Red too. So that&#8217;s two weekends running as he was on the sky news feed last weekend too. I know know we can expect even more people at work to have been woken up to the potential and to understand why were have all invested so much of ourselves in this. [...]]]></description>
