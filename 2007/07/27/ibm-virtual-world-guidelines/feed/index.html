		<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to let you know that you are accountable to yourself and your family and friends after the show ends. You need to have a more positive attitude about yourself and what you can accomplish. You shouldn’t need a show to keep you accountable. Weight loss is up to you and only you. Only you can control how much you eat when you exercise if you exercise if you gain the weight back, etc…..I want you to know that you can do it but it has to be up to you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, I think the Guidelines are a savvy piece of branding for IBM.  There&#039;s not much too them other than a generic warning to not act like an idiot online, but it does throw a lot of questions about identity, responsibility, and the uses for consensual online experience.  It&#039;s far  smarter marketing than one of those soaringly inane Sunday morning TV commercials, isn&#039;t it?  I&#039;ve written a bit more about it on my branding blog, DIM BULB, at http://dimbulb.typepad.com, if you want to check it out.  Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I gather Intel are shortly to release similar (?) guidelines. I can&#039;t see anything here to get too excited about, provided that such guidelines are &quot;policed&quot; by people who understand the SL (or VW) environment.

I agree with Ian&#039;s comments. SL is not like RL, and trying to emulate RL appearance is not the way to go. You simply don&#039;t &quot;blend in&quot;, and look out-of-place and false - the net effect is to undermine SL as a creative and &quot;alternative&quot; environment. On the other hand, extreme appearance is likely to devalue SL (and more importantly, you &#038; your own brand) in the eyes of many attendees. For those who advocate an open policy, I would suggest they consider their reaction to an attendee turning up as a giant set of male genitalia. There are few companies who would be cool with that.]]></description>
