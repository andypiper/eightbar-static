		<description><![CDATA[yes apologies to the regulars :-) Though I think I would change the focus a bit everynow and then. You should feel sorry for the rest of the internet team (hi guys and gals) who had to listen to the pitch when I gave it in RL 4 or 5 times a day.
It is a bit like doing a play, or a band doing their most popular song. If you love it, as I do it does not get tired. 
Football/soccer in SL would be interesting. Instrumenting the players and pitch in order to represent it.
Its not impossible as we sawa back with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/virtualreplay/euro2004/index.shtml?04039&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;BBC in 1996&lt;/a&gt; which I believe was rebuild from video captures]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It was a new experience, to watch an real game in near real time in SL.

And, I admire your stamina - I saw you tell the same story over and over again to anyone who would listen, throughout the days. 

What&#039;s next? Champions&#039; league final in SL?  ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] As Wimbledon wrapped up on Sunday and the final stats were tallied, I uploaded some of the video clips I took during my visit.
