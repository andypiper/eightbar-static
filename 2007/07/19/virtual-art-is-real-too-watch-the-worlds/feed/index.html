		<description><![CDATA[ohhh.....   i spend a good deal of my time trolling for virtual art.   if you take a gander through my picks in SL sometime, you will find a lot of it.  (thaumata strangelove.)  i particularly love the pieces from adam ramona, the work by angrybeth shortbread at the pencil factory, and actually, the van gogh museum in SL.  it&#039;s called Virtual Starry Night (I think) and has some amazing rebuilds of van gogh paintings that you can walk right into, 3D.   very lovely.   ps - say hello sometime.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Being Dutch, living in the south of France, driving to work at IBM Montpellier everyday passing fields with grapes and sunflowers, at work with a focus on virtual worlds..... This movie has now a special place in my hart.
Thank you very much Robbie...  
 
oh.... and I could not resist informing the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam (my place of birth) on your masterpiece as to ask their experts what they think of it from an artistic and cultural perspective. Will let you know if they reply.   Hope you don&#039;t mind.  
Thanks again.   Rick Reesen (aka Kareltje Krasker)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[thanks for sharing that Roo - beautiful.
I think the art world has so much to offer technology. Back in 96 I set up some meetings with artists and geeks here in Melbourne, getting them into the same room to talk about this new media thing. I&#039;d like to think some of them went on to become digital media gurus!
Sometimes you need artists, architects and musicians to help see the potential of new technologies. I was speaking earlier to Pavig Log - lead creator from the very hot Greenies sim. She told me she was a muscian who got into VR! The other designer of that sim has an art background. Look what they have done - amazing!

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed with your notions on virtual art.  It&#039;s something that I and my friends have been exploring at Oyster Bay.  Check out my blog - it&#039;s largely about SL art and my venue.  Kronos Kirkorian made a fantastic machinima as well of our spring show, and we&#039;ve just completed a dialogue on using SL as a medium to itself.  All that, and more, are available at my blog.  If you&#039;re inworld with some free time, look me up.  I&#039;d be happy to share what I can with you.]]></description>
