		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been experimenting with this model with RP systems, a high level storyline/character development that spans RP systems and other worlds. The Spin Martin brand exists in XBOX Live, EVE, and other places; the creative inspiration of one of our landmark sims extends to Warcraft, with sub-parallel storylines starting in WoW, bouncing to EVE, landing in SL-- creating this type of allegory of actual events, instead of taking creative IP without permission. 

Somewhat a mashup between clinically blogging actualy events devoid of specifics. Doing this with things like Twitter and such now.

Some people hate this, and yet as a creative, it really sharpens the skills. Now to map it to RL workflows.

Thanks for the link..]]></description>
