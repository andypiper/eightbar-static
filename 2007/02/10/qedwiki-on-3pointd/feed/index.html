		<description><![CDATA[End-user directed app development leads to changes in workflow and productivity that in turn lead to more end-user directed app development.  &quot;Hardened&quot; comes to mead ossified and unable to keep up with the rate of change.  I&#039;m a router jockey, not a developer, so maybe I&#039;m all wet on this.  But if not present reality, perhaps the trend?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree Vigna. We have I guess, often sene in IT the &#039;prototype&#039; end up become the main application and then having to design fixes around the initial build. 
What this does is speed up the cycle time and make it quicker for the users of information to work out what they need to do with it. 
Transitions from prototype/mashup/quick macro to a critical business system requires management and thought.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What happens when the feeds become unreliable or when teh mashup itself becomes business critical? 

This si easy -- it is no longer a sit app and therefore should be handled via traditional IT App Dev processes. 

However what percent of sit apps ever reach that threshold? Premise -- few. Therefore there is value in the ability to improve end-user productivity for sit apps.]]></description>
