		<description><![CDATA[The hands and this approach was very early. However we have a few people who are following this up. I was initially seeing how much work it was to do.
We have two options, manual position the elements for specific signs, or build a jointed mechanism that can deal with anything. 
I would prefer the latter as we could then learn through haptics and sending real life messages in.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a great idea... exploring alternative means of communications used by disabled people in a virtual reality simulator. How far did you get with the hands? Do you have a video of them doing the alphabet for instance yet?]]></description>
