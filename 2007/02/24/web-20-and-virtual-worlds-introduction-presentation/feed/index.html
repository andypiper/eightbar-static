		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;I should add a “wake up and smell the future” slide too, in order to open the eyes a little further.&#8221;</p>
<p>haha. I guess I should have read this before I responded to your email. In it (to keep others in the loop), I suggested a &#8220;Near Term Opportunities&#8221; slide followed by a &#8220;Long Term Possibilities&#8221; closing piece. The &#8220;Near Term&#8221; functions as the low-hanging fruit (which always makes companies happy). The &#8220;Long Term&#8221; scares the individuals within the company; wakes them up and encourages them to be more aware of what the &#8220;Near Term&#8221; is all about. That would hopefully decrease the number of bonehead efforts made by people out there trying to glom on to &#8220;the next hip thing&#8221;. Instead, they migh use those &#8220;Near Term&#8221; projects to educate themselves on the potential&#8230; even if that&#8217;s not the company intent.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[This got me thinking. The &quot;More possibilities&quot; list probably doesn&#039;t go nearly far enough. At this point I&#039;d be saying that we (as a company, and a world) have barely begun to scratch the surface of what virtual worlds make possible, and here are some relatively short term things the listener might want to consider.

I should add a &quot;wake up and smell the future&quot; slide too, in order to open the eyes a little further. :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[csven: that would fit in the (very incomplete) slide 25. At that point, in helping people wonder about more possibilities I&#039;m really just trying to get them to apply what they&#039;re thinking about to their own industry.

Spore is (hopefully) going to be cool. The massively-single-player idea, with its new approach to the way user generated content is shared and distributed, is really very interesting indeed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m curious: where do sticking the kind of user-generated content system which Will Wright is implementing in Spore; specifically the distribution system and the Digg-like rating system (which will very likely feed a Reputation system)?]]></description>
