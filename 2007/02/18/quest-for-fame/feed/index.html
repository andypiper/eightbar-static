		<description><![CDATA[I found a fenale cord that turns into a usb at a computer store in San Fancisco.  My problem is, I cannot get the game to play because in need to be played in Dos.  I hooked mine into a laptop with with the USB port, but I can not for the life of me to get the game to work  I loved this game and my daughter loved it so much that she asked for aoguitar for a Christmas about 8 years a go.  If anyone knows how to get the game to play on a Dell Laptop, please email me @ Mbradley@pacific.edu.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve just found my Quest for Fame game and plectrum...but there&#039;s no where to plug it into the back of the computer!  How gutting!  I suppose everything&#039;s USB now - it used to go into the printer slot at the back of the computer.
Anyone know whether I could rewire it?!?! : )
p.s. I&#039;ll never forget when I first made it to the stadium!! : )]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[CL, last I saw of it Namco had it. They had done a drum pad too. It was not as well done as the original(s).
Now if GH2 took story mode, threw the aerosmith songs on GH2 that would be very close indeed]]></description>
