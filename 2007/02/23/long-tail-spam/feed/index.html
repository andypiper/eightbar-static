		<description><![CDATA[I was expecting lots of pills and genital enhancements, but we seem to get lots of stuff about various makes of cars, as well as &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;nice&quot; and &quot;please&quot;. We&#039;ve had a WP site running for about a year, and have recently swapped over to Radiant (and moved comments over- 99% spam)
