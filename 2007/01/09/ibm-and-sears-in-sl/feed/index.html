		<description><![CDATA[Sears IBM Island will certainly capture attention.  Many customers require a visual picture before they are able to make a decision.  This will help increase sales and also make a contractor&#039;s job hassle-free.

Love it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Frank, it was a great chat. I was not at all offended but the garbage disposal comment, though now I understand why :-)
It seems that so much of what has happened the entire past year in SL has involved a higher than average amount of serendipity and good Karma.
Even at the lowest times, when it was almost worth giving up I tended to have a chance meeting to re-energize me and keep me going. Meeting Seth Witte, Jessica Qin, Nink Noonan and many others have all been signficant and memorable.
It is sometimes hard to make sure I get the time to help people, but I really do enjoy doing that.
It is also an important trend that we are all meeting both within our company and outside it. Many more people are able to share interactions across all sorts of boundaries. They can also happen in small bites rather than the large full on social fest of a 3 day convention which does not suit everyone.
So thankyou for the taking Rorok on the tour and introducing me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I (Yehoo Newall) was one of those passersby that you so eloquently entertained in front of the Sears Store. I had just connected with an old colleague (Rorok Longstaff) for the first time in world and was showing him some of the new business ideas that IBM was doing in SL. We had just seen the Circuit City store and were headed to Sears when we ran into you.

I was in the middle of telling him about the virtual kitchen concepts and his textures were a little slow coming down so when he first saw your AV, he literally thought you were a garbage disposal on legs, thinking it was some sort of gimmick and you were going to be a tallking garbage disposal doubling as a sales rep (actually there&#039;s another neat concept, have virtual appliance bots that can sell themselves).

So when he called your avatar a garbage disposal with legs, he was serious!!! I was a little aghast which is why I kind of hinted to Rorok that you were something of a Sl celebrity.

BTW, Rorok in RL has a VC who has funded him to explore business possibilities in SL so the time you spent chatting with him was invaluable!!! Having run into you when we did was incredibly good timing and we both mentioned that there must have been somne serious good karma involved with our meeting.]]></description>
