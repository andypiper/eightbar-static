		<description><![CDATA[David - we actually picked up on your comment on episode 83 of Dogear Nation (http://dogearnation.com). It&#039;s hard for me to see how pushing the boundaries and innovating is wasteful... we&#039;re learning how to engage in these new spaces. Bear in mind that this isn&#039;t all about Second Life, it is about the 3D Internet and virtual worlds in general. As for a so-called &quot;Third Life&quot; concept - what would you suggest? and why go further immediately when there&#039;s more to do in this existing space?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It will be interesting to see what is in store at the 2008 Australian Open. One year is a long time in terms of technology improvements. I enjoyed the 2007 version with the added dimension of the hawkeye system.

I wonder if players will better manage the challenge system. Some players seemed to have a knack of knowing when to challenge while others seemed to not have a clue.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] We have gone live with our mini build of for the French Open tennis on the &#8220;IBM 7&#8243; sim. We have previously had the builds for last years Wimbledon (video here) , and the previous Australian Open, but they were all private. This is out in the the public areas.  The team, Laronzo Fitzgerald, Andy Remblai and I have taken Pipe Hesse and Gizzy ElectricTeeth&#8217;s australian open and adjusted it for the Roland Garros event. We have all discovered on the way lots of interesting gotchas on collaborative building, with sharing of permissions and how to make things portable. The area itself is branded and in the style of the actual event with a central clay court.  We get data from the same feeds as we use for the website with current matches and complete matches represented on a main board. The court itself is central, it houses the match replay gadget. The replay shows the play of the ball from a rally and updates the main scoreboard. People can pose at each end of the court for a players view.  We are going to keep adjusting the experience as we have realized a few usability quirks that may not be obvious to people. 1. The rally is played after the real rally has finished, that is when the data is sent in Real/Web life. So the main scoreboard and court will always be behind the live one (at the moment) 2. When players change ends, or there is a break in play it looks like the court is not doing anything, so that may be confusing as a spectator 3. Rain delays, its started with one yesterday and we have not represented one as the Autralian Open has a roof. Anyway we welcome your comments on it, as we try and bring the experience of the tennis event to the metaverse. The main website extends the experience with news and photos aswell as scores. In Second Life we can obvioulsy extend that experience to one that can be shared.

		<description><![CDATA[[...] Ian Hughes who has pioneered this tennis project with others at IBM sent me a message from Second Life earlier, in response to my questions about when tennis on Second Life would open to the public: The tri board has schedule, completed matches and matches in progress, the main court will be showing live current match (all being well) or a replay of a match some videos and other things around.
