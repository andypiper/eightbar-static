		<description><![CDATA[I got the book as well, but it&#039;s going to be a real bugger to get it signed by all  the authors.

It&#039;s also good to have a book that you can see people that you know, and have met. It&#039;s like having a part of them, but I feel part of the book because some of these people are my friends.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So you got the book too :-) my copy arrived from Amazon a few days back. I haven&#039;t had the chance to get too much into in yet but I agree this will be the absolutely essential &#039;historical reference&#039; for the early culture of SL within the overall evolution of metaverses. In addition, in its own right as an actual book today, it does give a good overview tour of what&#039;s SL &#038; what you can do with it. I personally find this is a very useful short cut to finding things out that I might - one day - have found another way!]]></description>
