		<description><![CDATA[@tina I have added a seperate post just now to explain. This is mine and my friends blog. We surely reserve the right to keep things on topic. I self censored. No big deal. 
I stand behind the fact that I am willing to share with my colleagues an oppinion. Sure we can share it wider (as you have done). As I have pointed out I already had. 
Each blog and place does nto have to have the same level of detail. Eightbar is light hearted, enjoyable and innovative and a set of IBMers.
My personal blog is that, personal. My internal blog is aimed at a different audience and playing with different concepts, just as terra nova was different again.
So I am not in any closet. It is handy that you are forcing the issue and making decisions for me, its like having a press agent :-) thanks. 
I would have liked to have had the freedom of my own information and my own speech but you appear to have decided to take that away from me.]]></description>
