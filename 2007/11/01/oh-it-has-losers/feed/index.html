		<description><![CDATA[At the risk of self-promotion, you might want to check out the lengthy comment from Clear Ink posted on Slambling in response to my &quot;viral approach to SL&quot; entry.

A point about Jim that I gleaned from another site. It seems that Jim may not, in fact, have acquired an avatar to get at Dwight, but actually had had an avatar for some time, with his lengthy past in SL. Hence adding yet more irony to his &quot;Oh it has losers...&quot; statement. 

In any event, I think this has been a great example of Second Life in the mainstream (to paraphrase Gwyn Llewelyn)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes. I should have mentioned the wider plot. It&#039;s quite touching, really. Good old Jim. It&#039;s a good line though. &quot;Oh, it has losers&quot; has made me chuckle nearly constantly since I saw the clip.]]></description>
