		<description><![CDATA[Good afternoon,

We’re running a video advertising campaign for a well-known drinks brand and would be interested in buying some advertising or advertorial space on your blog. Sorry- couldn’t see where to get in touch (the email address does not work)

Best regards,

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Roo,

Thanks for taking the time to read the book. I&#039;m sorry that some errors crept in. No excuse, of course, but the nature of the material meant that we were working to a freakishly tight deadline. We tried to check everything absolutely thoroughly, but I guess the odd thing slipped through.

So...

&#039;Edward&#039; Palmisano: D&#039;oh! That one&#039;s pretty unforgivable. Will make sure it&#039;s fixed in any future editions.  

Hursley Island: yep, we wrote that part prior to the island coming out in the open. I&#039;m afraid that one&#039;s down to publishing lead times. 

IBM Employees Worldwide: Yes, sorry, should have made it much clearer that it was an unofficial group.  

Home of Roo Reynolds: that one&#039;s down to me. I know it&#039;s not just your blog, but because I was introduced to it through your contributions, I always think of it as yours. But yes, I should have made it clearer. Sorry, sorry - will update to give Ian full credit in future editions. 

Hope you enjoy the rest of the book. Obviously, the intended audience is the complete newbie - and hopefully it will encourage a few more people to give SL a try. But obviously, being aimed at newbies gives us arguably more of a duty to be absolutely accurate as they&#039;re less likely to know when they&#039;re being unintentionally misled. 

Thanks again for taking the time to look through the book. We may well take you up on that offer of proof reading for the next edition!

Cheers,

Paul]]></description>
