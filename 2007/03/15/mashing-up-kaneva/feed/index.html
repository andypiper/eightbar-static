		<description><![CDATA[Interesting ponderings, Mr Hughes.

I&#039;ve got myself Kaneva and There accounts - but am way too much of a noob yet to have any sensible comment. However, they are both fast, clean interfaces - unlike SL - and may be ideal for simple &quot;remote meetings&quot;, where you want a simple interface (shallow learning curve) and quick-to-build, simple meeting areas for groups/communities of interest. SL is arguably a sledgehammer for cracking this particular nut.

That said, as an Ancient of Days, I found Kaneva confusing to use (no obvious orientation or help with starting inworld) and There too chatty &#038; patronising. No pleasing some folk I guess.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It looks like the current Kaneva allows you (once you buy the right tv&#039;s and boomboxes) to grab content from keneva. i.e. you have to uplad everything into you &#039;space&#039; 
So live gigs, and I may be wrong, dont look veyr easy to do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just joined kaneva and am still in the rave stage (OK, I have like 5 of them so far so I&#039;m really just starting.) In my initial foray, I couldn&#039;t find any info on the ability to stream live music (via a stream) into kaneva as in SL. Do you know if this is possible yet? I&#039;m interested in doing a gig in SL and having it streamed live into kaneva; first audio, and then via the hopefully soon to be released SL-to-web.

Any thoughts?
