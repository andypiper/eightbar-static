		<description><![CDATA[The video used for &#039;co-creation&#039; part wasn&#039;t made by architecture students, but was a demonstration by the RL Architects Group in Second Life, on Architecture Island.  

This demonstration led to the creation of a &#039;Wikitecture&#039; group that is examining the principles of co-creation, and developing tools to enable a true &#039;Wiki&#039; style building methodology.  Please contact Keystone Bouchard or Theory Shaw in-world for more info.  

Thanks for posting this!  It is very well done.]]></description>
