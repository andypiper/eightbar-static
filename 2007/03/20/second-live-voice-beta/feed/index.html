		<description><![CDATA[But we have to remember, voice needs to be optional and avatars who choose not to use voice should not be discriminated against or made to look stupid like having a floating red text over our heads saying NO VOICE.  Remember:
- People live together in RL, and the computer might be in a shared space where &quot;chatting&quot; is annoying to others
- It might be too near background noise - TV that others are watching, kitchen area, etc.
- It&#039;s often in the bedroom, where someone else is sleeping (aren&#039;t you up to all hours???)
- and sometimes your sweet lilted voice just doesn&#039;t convey the look of the burly truck driver you&#039;ve chosen to be (or vice versa!)

Hopefully people will remember this and still be inclusive to chatters...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course, the Snow Crash metaverse has full voice integration, so I&#039;m pleased to see SL trying it too.
In fact in Snow Crash, it seems to be somewhat seamlessly linked to the cellphone network, which is a nice idea ... avatars with phone numbers so you can patch FL phone calls through to them... I wonder what the SL country code prefix will be!
But I think it needs to be optional... just as picking the phone up and calling someone you&#039;re Instant Messaging with is still optional over here in Reality.]]></description>
