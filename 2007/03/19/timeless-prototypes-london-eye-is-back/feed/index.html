		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m pleased to announce that the London Eye is coming back - we&#039;ve negotiated with Timeless Prototype to have it built on the British Council Second Life project in both Teen Grid and Main Grid Isles.

It&#039;s not yet up in the Main Grid, but it&#039;s up and fully working in the Teen Grid. You can see pictures here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/grahamstanley/524584197/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately it has gone again. The rare appearance of the &#039;Eye was at a special request from Boris Frampton (SL name) of IBM for a party they had on Friday. I kept it up for a little bit longer than was required and took it down this evening. However, it&#039;s already destined to make some appearances in some machinima movies that are being produced in Second Life. Keep an eye out for it (lol, sorry, no pun intended).]]></description>
