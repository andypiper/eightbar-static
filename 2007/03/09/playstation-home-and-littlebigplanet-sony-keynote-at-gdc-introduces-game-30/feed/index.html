		<description><![CDATA[Of course Sony being Sony is going to try to shoehorn us into some proprietary technology while their competition (xbox, gamecube) is making it far easier for developers to do cross platform programming.

they need to open the doors to the developers as well as lower any cost barriers to encourage cottage sofware houses to adopt the platform THEN you will see a turnaround.

they need the third party!]]></description>
