		<description><![CDATA[[...] Roo wrote a post with a nice video here of AM Radio&#8217;s delightful piece of art creation. The Cornfield, 1920&#8217;s style with a fantastic textured train and some incredible prebaking of textures. We had seen this buidl happen on our internal blogs, and it was good to see it go public. Now AM Radio has decided to raise some funds for the charity heifer.org but selling copies of his work that you can go and view here. Its a subtle yet amazingly detailed set of objects and well worth a look. I will post some stills when they get through the system, but I needed to post this update for all you art appreciating and charity minded individuals out there. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[AM Radio&#039;s work has always been impressive to me.  I hadn&#039;t seen some of these builds before... Thanks for sharing them epredator.  The other thing that I love is that they are not sculpties, but they are built up from primitives.  I had AM on my Trippin&#039; the Verse podcast some time ago and he explained a lot of his technique,]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Roo,

Re: Other examples... You&#039;ve probably seen this already as I think it&#039;s had a fair amount of publicity, but I was pretty impressed by the DanCoyote Antonelli exhibit at Arts &#038; Letters. See

http://www.secondlifeinsider.com/2007/08/13/artist-dancoyote-antonelli-redefines-space-and-immersive-art/

It&#039;s important to follow the advice in the landing area about changing the client settings to get the full impact, I think. It is almost &quot;overpowering&quot; at times, but it seemed to me another good example of exploiting some of the capabilities of SL as a medium.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great find. I had not seen either of them. I&#039;m simply stunned. It is far more appealing than the spinning signs in world and much of anything you can find on TV. Would someone w/o exposure to Second Life have the same level of appreciation? I am new to Second Life and my pathetic attempts at construction may have altered my level of amazement.
