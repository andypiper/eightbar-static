		<description><![CDATA[[...] Recipe for a Virtual World 3:&#160;places    Virtual Worlds need people and people need places. For collaboration or socialising, a sense of place sets virtual worlds apart from alternatives like instant messaging and conference calls. As in the real world, meeting to play games or do business (or both) in a virtual world needs a place to do it. Unlike the real world, there are few constraints to limit these places. It doesn&#8217;t rain if you don&#8217;t want it to, and you don&#8217;t need shade from the sun, so a roof becomes an aesthetic choice rather than a necessity. Physics; what goes up, might come down if you want it to. Yet the possibilities are not endless if you want a virtual space to be successful: the remaining constraints, other than any technical limitations, are formed by people&#8217;s expectations. And discovering what those are, and how they vary, is going to be interesting. (I&#8217;m going to predict that 3d blinking text won&#8217;t be popular!) [...]]]></description>
