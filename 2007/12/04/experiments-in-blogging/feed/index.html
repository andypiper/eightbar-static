		<description><![CDATA[@tina I am bothered that it was not on the topic of 3d printers. Just spam in that post.
I am bothered, as I said before that you have decided to take away my rights of free speech.
I am more worried that you seem to need some sort of victory against me when all I have done is suggest some ideas. 
What is there to be tenable or untenable about. I am just not so happy with the way my company has treated me, but still love the job and the people around me that do it? 
The views on this blog (in the main posts) are ours and ours alone. The comments we cannot be responsible for, but off topic and/or offensive etc we reserve editorial rights over.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lol, you clearly are bothered otherwise why delete my comment which concerned the concept of the deniable responsibility of this blog.  Even the CIA does not think this is a tenable position now.  Hypocrisy is always a difficult position to defend when it gets found out!]]></description>
