		<description><![CDATA[The other thing I think I like about the 5th wave/Web 2.0 is that it&#039;s all web native.  You don&#039;t need applets or plugins or hassle it all works directly with the browser.  Even where Flash is used it&#039;s started to be better integrated with the rest of the site, so you don&#039;t know you&#039;re even using Flash.  Flickr is the best example of this I can think of.]]></description>
