		<description><![CDATA[Yes the 5440 Dolphin was named after the pub but the &quot;Winchester&quot; drives were not.  The Winchester drive was developed in San Jose. It was named after the Winchester 30 30 rifle because it had 30Mb of capacity in removable storage on the top and another 30 below.

Hursley Park was OK for a few years but walking around the village gets old.

The bakery was great.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Darren

This is a nice write up:)  I particularly enjoy reminding my American colleagues and customers that many pubs, like the one you describe, are twice as old as America, (just to get some perspective going!).  Finally, given your refreshing write up on the drinking trends and behaviour&#039;s of the IBM Hursley population, I feel MUCH less guilty now for sneaking in lto the Dolphin ast Friday to the lunchtime for a &#039;quicky&#039;.  But having seen the place, I&#039;m booking a meal with famly over the Christmas break. Hursley sounds like my kind of location - completely dry at Bedfont and an awkward drive on a Friday for a pie and pint!  Happy Christmas.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I also heard the S/390 was named after the A3090 main road between Winchester and Romsey, but the A was switched for a more curly and organic &#039;S&#039; by marketing, and the 0 was dropped by someone in accounting to save on the (then expensive) rub-through transfers used to create the badges on the front panels.  Could be wrong though...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d always heard that the Winchester disk was named after the nearby city of Winchester. However, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia says&lt;/a&gt;

&quot;In 1973, IBM introduced the 3340 &#039;Winchester&#039; disk system (the 30MB + 30 millisecond access time led the project to be named after the Winchester 30-30 rifle)&quot;

which I could also believe. Not sure about Dolphin, though it&#039;s toothier cousin the &lt;a href=&quot;http://websphereadvisor.com/doc/07608&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Shark&lt;/a&gt; was certainly another famous storage product.]]></description>
