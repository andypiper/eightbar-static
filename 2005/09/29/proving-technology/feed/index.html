		<description><![CDATA[It is true that the generalist way of working, combining roles and having a go to produce a result, does not suit everyone. The thing with working in Hursley is that there is room for all sorts of ways of operating. The people working on product development are in quality controlled processes to document the products and move it through all it stages of development and testing against rigourous designs. The pre sales tech people have to know the released products in depth and be onsite to help people. The Global Services people have a mix of rigourous process and felxibilityt to solve big customer problems. In Emergeing Technology Services we, as Darren has said, adjust to whatever we need to do, generally on a small projetc with a big impact. It sounds like Jack of all trades master of none, but in fact its Jack of all trades, master of some.
