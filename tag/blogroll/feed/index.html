				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve just done a sweep through the eightbar blogroll and links. From the look of what was there, I reckon we hadn&#8217;t checked it in a while, as a few of the links were dead or pointing at blogs which have long since relocated. I also updated a few of the <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/about/">About</a> pages to reflect recent changes.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got two main categories of links &#8211; <b>Blogroll</b> <i>broadly</i> covers &#8220;former eightbar and sites of interest&#8221; and <b>Hursley bloggers</b> contains links to current active bloggers from the Hursley(ish) community. Check them out over towards the bottom of the sidebar. If I&#8217;ve missed an active Hursley person that I should have included, then it should be pretty easy to find me and let me know <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
