				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the <a href="http://london.greenhackathon.com/">London Green Hackathon</a> a few weeks ago, the small team that had coalesced around our table (<a title="Alex Hartley on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#!/alexharteco">Alex</a>, <a title="Alex Hutter on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#!/aefaradien">Alex</a>, <a title="Andy Piper on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#!/andypiper">Andy</a>, and me) had got to about 10pm on Saturday night without a good idea for a hack, in this case a piece of cool software relevant to the theme of sustainability. We were thinking about creating a UK version of the US-based <a href="http://www.goodguide.com/">Good Guide</a> app using on their API to which we had access. The Good Guide rates products according to their social, environmental, and health impacts; the company makes this data available in an API, a format that programmers can use to write applications. Good Guide uses this API itself to produce a mobile app which consumers can use to scan barcodes of products to get information about them before purchase.</p>
<p><a href="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMAG0225-cropped.jpg"><img class="centered" src="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMAG0225-cropped-300x174.jpg" alt="Discussing ideas" title="Discussing ideas" width="300" height="174" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1159" /></a></p>
<p>The problem is that the 60,000 products listed in the Good Guide are US brands. We guessed that some would be common to the UK though. We wondered if it would be possible to match the Good Guide list against the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&%23038;q=www.amazon.co.uk&%23038;source=web&%23038;cd=1&%23038;ved=0CCAQFjAA&%23038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2F&%23038;ei=res2T8O_PIKf0QXinrSRAg&%23038;usg=AFQjCNFsMQqmiYEP6reOV8o1bSlfk_UbLg">Amazon.co.uk</a> product list so that we could look up the Good Guide information about those products at least. Unfortunately, when we (<a title="Andy Piper on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#!/andypiper">Andy</a>) tried this, we discovered that Amazon uses non-standard product IDs in its site so it wasn’t possible to match the two product lists.</p>
<p>The equivalent of the Good Guide in the UK is <a href="http://www.ethical-company-organisation.org/the-good-shopping-guide.htm">The Good Shopping Guide</a>, of which we had an old copy handy. The Good Shopping Guide is published each year as a paperback book which, while a nicely laid out read, isn’t that practical for carrying with you to refer to when shopping. We discovered that <a href="http://www.ethical-company-organisation.org/">The Ethical Company</a> (who produce the Good Shopping Guide) have also released an <a href ="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/the-good-shopping-guide-ethical/id416083134?mt=8">iPhone app</a> of the book&#8217;s content but it hasn’t received especially good reviews; a viewing of <a href="http://www.ethical-company-organisation.org/ethicalshoppingapp.htm">the video tour of the app</a> seems to reveal why.</p>
<p><a href="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMAG0231-cropped.jpg"><img class="centered" src="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMAG0231-cropped-300x158.jpg" alt="Quite late at night" title="Quite late at night" width="300" height="158" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1158" /></a></p>
<p>By this point it was getting on for midnight and the two coders in our team, <a title="Andy Piper on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#!/andypiper">Andy</a> and <a title="Alex Hartley on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#!/alexharteco">Alex</a>, had got distracted <a href="http://vaguehope.com/2012/01/mqtt-kindlet/">hacking a Kindle</a>. <a title="Alex Hartley on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#!/alexharteco">Alex</a> and I, therefore, decided to design the mobile app that we would’ve written had we (a) had access to the Good Shopping Guide API and (b) been able to write the code needed to develop the app.</p>
<p>While we didn’t have an actual software or hardware hack to present back at the end of the hackathon weekend, we were able to present our mockups which we called our ‘UX hack’ (a reference to the apparently poor user experience (UX) of the official Good Shopping Guide mobile app). Here are the mockups themselves, along with a summary of the various ideas our team had discussed throughout the first day of the hackathon:</p>
