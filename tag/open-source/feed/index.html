				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://monkigras.com/" title="monkigras.com">Monki Gras</a> happened again!

<h2>What is Monki Gras?</h2>
<p>Well&#8230;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>So, how to explain <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a>? Like TED but smaller, more random and with <a href="https://twitter.com/monkchips">@monkchips</a> in charge</p>

<p>And Ricardo makes a good point, explaining why I, and others, just keep going back:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>Back home from <a href="https://twitter.com/monkigras">@monkigras</a>.  <a href="https://twitter.com/redmonk">@redmonk</a> has me completely spoiled as to what a conference is supposed to be like.</p>
<p>&mdash; Ricardo J. Méndez (@ArgesRic) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArgesRic/status/561647182278066177">January 31, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a single track of talks so you are saved the effort of making decisions about what to see and you can just focus on listening. The speakers entertain as well as inform, which, I really like.</p>
<p>While it is a tech conference, there&#8217;s little code because it&#8217;s about making technology happen rather than the details of the technology itself. So there are talks on developer culture, design, and data, as well as slightly more off-the-wall things to keep our brains oiled.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/monkchips" title="James Governor on Twitter">James&#8217;</a> very own distinctive words:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>turns out if you ask people to be creative and not just give the normal pitch they do a fucking great job. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/protip?src=hash">#protip</a> for conference organisers</p>
<p>&mdash; Mönki Gras (@monkigras) <a href="https://twitter.com/monkigras/status/560812330234425344">January 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>What a great crowd, all celebrating <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/nordiccraft?src=hash">#nordiccraft</a>! <a href="http://t.co/2wmsrrzv52">pic.twitter.com/2wmsrrzv52</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Mönki Gras (@monkigras) <a href="https://twitter.com/monkigras/status/560854249492729858">January 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<h2>Why go all Nordic this year?</h2>
<p>All the speakers this year were Scandinavian in some way. It was probably the most rigorously applied conference theme I&#8217;ve ever seen (mostly, conferences come up with a &#8216;theme&#8217; for marketing purposes which usually gets mostly forgotten about by the time of the conference itself).</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>What have the Nordics done for us? &lt;- Basically the theme for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a> this year. Turns out, quite a lot. ☺</p>
<p>&mdash; Laura Cowen (@lauracowen) <a href="https://twitter.com/lauracowen/status/560815323419803648">January 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>James talks a bit more about this on the <a href="http://monkigras.com/blog/" title="Scandinavian focus on the Monkigras blog">Monkigras blog</a>. A surprising amount of tech we know and love comes out of the relatively sparsely populated Scandinavian countries. For example:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/monkchips">@monkchips</a> Yes please. Don&#39;t forget, Finland builds our internet <img src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> &lt;3 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ssh?src=hash">#ssh</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/irc?src=hash">#irc</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/git?src=hash">#git</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Linux?src=hash">#Linux</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MySQL?src=hash">#MySQL</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/opensource?src=hash">#opensource</a> cc <a href="https://twitter.com/GabbiCahane">@gabbicahane</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/monkigras">@monkigras</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Pia Henrietta K (@PHenriettaK) <a href="https://twitter.com/PHenriettaK/status/552135512203726848">January 5, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>And, apparently, Finland leads the EU in enterprise cloud computing:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Cloud computing used by 1 in 5 enterprises in the EU in 2014, 1 in 2 in Finland <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Eurostat?src=hash">#Eurostat</a> <a href="http://t.co/CuMAzNIPoD">http://t.co/CuMAzNIPoD</a> <a href="http://t.co/JGMwAJ1v5Y">pic.twitter.com/JGMwAJ1v5Y</a></p>
<p>&mdash; European Commission (@EU_Commission) <a href="https://twitter.com/EU_Commission/status/542260605542203392">December 9, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Are the Nordics really that different from anywhere else?</h2>
<p>Well, this graph seems to say they are, if only for their taste in music:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>Metal bands per 100.000 inhabitants <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a> <a href="http://t.co/eTZf2MJl59">pic.twitter.com/eTZf2MJl59</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Lars Trieloff (@trieloff) <a href="https://twitter.com/trieloff/status/560854416564449280">January 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Which suggests there is at least <em>something</em> different about Nordic cultures from the rest of Europe, let alone the world.</p>
<p>So several of the speakers delved into why they thought this led to success in technology innovation and development. For example, there&#8217;s the attitude to not recognising when you&#8217;re failing and giving up so that you can be successful by doing it another way:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>There is no shame in turning around and giving up. And give up as soon as possible then you don&#39;t die. &#8211; Norwegian Mountain Code. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Laura Cowen (@lauracowen) <a href="https://twitter.com/lauracowen/status/560766645925605376">January 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>A Swedish concept, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagom" title="Lagom on Wikipedia">lagom</a></em>, which means &#8216;just the right amount&#8217; was credited with the popularity of the cloud in the Nordics. And, indeed, with pretty much anything we could think of throughout the rest of the event.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>The cloud is more popular in the Nordics, because it allows you to spend just the right amount (lagom) on infrastructure <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Lars Trieloff (@trieloff) <a href="https://twitter.com/trieloff/status/560783321144492035">January 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Similarly, you could argue that lagom is why Docker is popular among developers:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>Why is <a href="https://twitter.com/docker">@docker</a> so hot? It allows developers to get back to craftsmanship, not to worry about things they don&#39;t care about <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Danese Cooper (@DivaDanese) <a href="https://twitter.com/DivaDanese/status/561151492774973440">January 30, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p>One fascinating talk, by a Swedish speaker based in Silicon Valley, was about the difference between startups in the Nordics and Silicon Valley. For example, the inescapable differences between their welfare systems were credited as being responsible for different priorities regarding making money. (Hopefully, videos of the talks will be put online and I&#8217;ll add a link to it.)</p>
<p>Obviously, all this talk about culture can, and did, drift into stereotyping. I did get slightly weary of the repeated comparisons between cultures, though interesting and, often, humorous.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Anyone who uses stereotypes is a terrible person. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Simon Phipps (@webmink) <a href="https://twitter.com/webmink/status/561124125708914690">January 30, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Developer culture</h2>
<p>One of the things I&#8217;m most interested in is hearing what other companies have learnt about developer culture and community. For example:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>Spotify has scaled to over 1,200 people by getting developers to work in small autonomous &quot;Squads&quot; <a href="http://t.co/5yFvMBQcvn">http://t.co/5yFvMBQcvn</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Sam Shead (@Sam_L_Shead) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sam_L_Shead/status/562255415812292609">February 2, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>There&#8217;s more about this talk on <a href="http://www.techworld.com/startups/spotify-developer-squads-key-swedish-startups-success-3596415/" title="Spotify's developer squads on Techworld">Techworld</a>. And Spotify have blogged some funky videos about the developer culture they aspire to (<a href="https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/" title="Spotify engineering culture: part 1">part 1</a> and <a href="https://labs.spotify.com/2014/09/20/spotify-engineering-culture-part-2/" title="Spotify engineering culture: part 2">part 2</a>), which are well worth watching if you work in software development.</p>
<p>Something that I&#8217;m working on at IBM is increasing the openness of our development teams so, again, I&#8217;m always interested in new ways to do this. This is something that Sweden (yes, the country!) has adopted to a surprising extent:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Swedish citizens take turns at curating the official <a href="https://twitter.com/sweden">@sweden</a> Twitter account! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Laura Cowen (@lauracowen) <a href="https://twitter.com/lauracowen/status/560746078585507840">January 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Innovation and inefficiencies</h2>
<p>One important message that came across at Monki Gras 2015 was that you have to allow time for innovation to happen. It&#8217;s when things seem inefficient and time is not allocated to a specific activity that innovation often occurs.</p>
<p>A nice example of this is the BrewPi project. At Monki Gras 2013, Elco Jacobs talked about his open source project of brewing beer and using a Raspberry Pi to monitor it:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OeVKxg8NP_I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I bumped into him this year and what had been a project now occupies him full-time as a small business selling the technology to brewers around the world. A pause in his education when he had nothing better to do had enabled him to get on with his BrewPi project and, after graduation, turn it into a business.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Fun conversations about <a href="https://twitter.com/brew_pi">@brew_pi</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a> <a href="http://t.co/sXYGvJ6ck5">http://t.co/sXYGvJ6ck5</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Paul Johnston (@PaulDJohnston) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulDJohnston/status/561169434501713920">January 30, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>It&#39;s really important that Finland has really inefficient universities because people start tinkering and solving problems <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Paul Johnston (@PaulDJohnston) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulDJohnston/status/560817347767050240">January 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Data journalism</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot talked about <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2014/apr/15/big-data-open-data-transform-government" title="Big data vs open data in The Guardian">open data</a> and how we should be able to access tax-funded data about things that affect our lives. The Guardian is taking a lead with <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/data-journalism" title="Data journalism at The Guardian">data journalism</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/HelenaBengtsson">Helena Bengtsson</a> gave a talk about how knowing how to navigate large data sets to find meaning was vital to finding stories in the Wikileaks data.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Inspiring talk on “Data Journalism” from <a href="https://twitter.com/HelenaBengtsson">@HelenaBengtsson</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a>. Talking through how learning simple SQL helped use <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks">@wikileaks</a> data.</p>
<p>&mdash; Daniel Appelquist (@torgo) <a href="https://twitter.com/torgo/status/560830299106340864">January 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>She started out in data journalism in Sweden where, in one case, she acquired and mapped large data sets that revealed water pollution problems around the country, which triggered a several stories.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just having the data that matters but the interpretation of the data. That&#8217;s what data journalism gives us over just &#8216;big data':</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/beauvais">@beauvais</a>: Sure. We see the same with our analysis. When we hand people data, they largely don&#39;t care, without the interpretation.</p>
<p>&mdash; Donnie Berkholz (@dberkholz) <a href="https://twitter.com/dberkholz/status/560830919011885056">January 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Also, I found out a fascinating fact:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Scandinavia: gov info is public unless classified otherwise. Rest of Europe: gov info is confidential unless they say otherwise. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Laura Cowen (@lauracowen) <a href="https://twitter.com/lauracowen/status/560833203158929409">January 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s about as much as I can cram in. We also found out random things about Scandinavian knitwear and the fact that Sweden has its own official typeface, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/14/sweden-sans-designers-create-national-font" title="Sweden Sans in The Guardian">Sweden Sans</a>. And we ate lots of Nordic foods, drank Nordic beer and (some of us) drank Akvavit. And, most importantly, we talked to each other lots.</p>
<p>The thing I really value about Monki Gras (on top of the great talks, food, drink, and fun atmosphere) is the small size of the event and all the interesting people to talk to. That&#8217;s why I keep going back.</p>
<p>P.S. <a href="http://tangentialthoughts.com/it-trends/monkigras-becomes-nordigras/" title="Monki Gras 2015 write-up">A good write-up of the talks</a></p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>ThingMonk 2013 was a two-day conference about the Internet of Things in London. Organised by RedMonk and sponsored by, among others, IBM.</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/2013/12/15/thingmonk-2013/">At ThingMonk 2013</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog">LauraCowen.co.uk</a>.</p> <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/2013/12/15/at-thingmonk-2013/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I attended <a href="http://redmonk.com/thingmonk/">ThingMonk 2013</a> conference partly because <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/info/internet-of-things/">IBM&#8217;s doing a load of work around the Internet of Things</a> (IoT). I figured it would be useful to find out what&#8217;s happening in the world of IoT at the moment. Also, I knew that, as a *Monk production, the food would be amazing.</span></p>
<h2><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">What is the Internet of Things?</span></h2>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">If you&#8217;re reading this, you&#8217;re familiar with using devices to access information, communicate, buy things, and so on over the Internet. The Internet of Things, at a superficial level, is just taking the humans out of the process. So, for example, if your washing machine were connected to the Internet, it could automatically book a service engineer if it detects a fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I say &#8216;at a superficial level&#8217; because there are obviously still issues relevant to humans in an automated process. It matters that the automatically-scheduled appointment is convenient for the householder. And it matters that the householder trusts that the machine really is faulty when it says it is and that it&#8217;s not the manufacturer just calling out a service engineer to make money.</span></p>
<p>This is how <a href="https://twitter.com/monkchips">James Governor</a> of <a href="http://redmonk.com/">RedMonk</a>, who conceived and hosted ThingMonk 2013, explains IoT:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R_muAEDXx2o?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2>What is ThingMonk 2013?</h2>
<p>ThingMonk 2013 was a fun two-day conference in London. On Monday was a hackday with spontaneous lightning talks and on Tuesday were the scheduled talks and the evening party. I wasn&#8217;t able to attend Monday&#8217;s hackday so you&#8217;ll have to read someone else&#8217;s write-up about that (you could try <a href="http://josiemessa.wordpress.com/2013/12/09/thingmonk-day-1/">Josie Messa&#8217;s</a>, for instance).</p>
<h2>The talks</h2>
<p>I bought my Arduino getting started kit (which I used for <a title="Electricity monitoring with Christmas lights and Arduino" href="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/2010/02/09/electricity-monitoring-with-christmas-lights-and-arduino/">my Christmas lights energy project</a> in 2010) from Tinker London so I was pleased to finally meet Tinker&#8217;s former-CEO, <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://twitter.com/iotwatch">Alexandra Dechamps-Sonsino</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">, at ThingMonk 2013. I&#8217;ve known her on Twitter for about 4 years but we&#8217;d never met in person. Alex is also founder of the <a href="https://twitter.com/GNLteam">Good Night Lamp</a>, which <a title="The Ambient Kettle" href="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/2013/03/16/the-ambient-kettle/">I blogged about earlier this year</a>. She talked at ThingMonk about &#8220;the past, present and future of the Internet of Things&#8221; from her position of being part of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I think it was probably </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://twitter.com/knolleary">Nick O&#8217;Leary</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> who first introduced me to the Arduino, many moons ago over cups of tea at work. He spoke at ThingMonk about </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://knolleary.net/2013/12/05/wiring-the-internet-of-things-thingmonk-talk/">wiring the Internet of Things</a>. This included a demo of <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">his latest project, </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://nodered.org/">NodeRED</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">, which he and IBM have recently </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://github.com/node-red/node-red">open sourced on GitHub</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">.</span></p>

<p>Sadly I missed the previous day when it seems Nick and colleagues, <a href="https://twitter.com/ceejay">Dave C-J</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/andysc">Andy S-C</a>, won over many of the hackday attendees to the view that IBM&#8217;s <a href="http://mqtt.org/">MQTT</a> and NodeRED are the coolest things known to developerkind right now. So many people mentioned one or both of them throughout the day. One developer told me he didn&#8217;t know why he&#8217;d not tried MQTT 4 years ago. He also seemed interested in playing with NodeRED, just as soon as the shock that IBM produces cool things for developers had worn off.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/ianskerrett">Ian Skerrett</a> from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> talked about the role of Open Source in the Internet of Things. Eclipse has recently started the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/paho/">Paho</a> project, which focuses on open source implementations of the standards and protocols used in IoT. The project includes IBM&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/groups/service/html/communityview?communityUuid=d5bedadd-e46f-4c97-af89-22d65ffee070">Really Small Message Broker</a> and Roger Light&#8217;s <a href="http://mosquitto.org/">Mosquitto</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/andypiper">Andy Piper</a> talked about <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/andypiper/the-internet-of-things-is-made-of-signals">the role of signals in the IoT</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2002" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_1546-300x210.jpg" alt="IMG_1546" width="300" height="210" /></p>
<p>There were a couple of talks about people&#8217;s experiences of startups producing physical objects compared with producing software. <a href="http://twitter.com/tomtaylor">Tom Taylor</a> talked about setting up <a href="http://www.newspaperclub.com/">Newspaper Club</a>, which is a site where you can put together and get printed your own newspaper run. His presentation included this slide:</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/genmon"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2000" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_1534-300x191.jpg" alt="IMG_1534" width="300" height="191" />Matt Webb</a> talked about producing <a href="http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/">Little Printer</a>, which is an internet-connected device that subscribes to various sources and prints them for you on a strip of paper like a shop receipt.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/goodmachine"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2003" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_1550-300x195.jpg" alt="IMG_1550" width="300" height="195" />Patrick Bergel</a> made the very good point in his talk that a lot of IoT projects, at the moment, are aimed at &#8216;non-problems&#8217;. While fun and useful for learning what we can do with IoT technologies, they don&#8217;t really address the needs of real people (ie people who aren&#8217;t &#8220;hackers, hipsters, or weirdos&#8221;). For instance, there are increasing numbers of older people who could benefit from things that address problems social isolation, dementia, blindness, and physical and cognitive impairments. His point was underscored throughout the day by examples of fun-but-not-entirely-useful-as-is projects, such as flying a drone with fruit. That&#8217;s not to say such projects are a waste of time in themselves but that we should get moving on projects that address real problems too.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2001" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_1539-300x226.jpg" alt="IMG_1539" width="300" height="226" />The talk which chimed the most with me, though, was <a href="http://twitter.com/clurr">Claire Rowland</a>&#8216;s on the important user experience UX issues around IoT. She spoke about the importance of understanding how users (householders) make sense of automated things in their homes.</p>

<h2>The book</h2>
<p>I bought a copy of <a href="https://twitter.com/amcewen">Adrian McEwan</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://book.roomofthings.com/">Designing The Internet of Things</a> book from Alex&#8217;s pop-up shop, <a href="https://twitter.com/Works_Shop">(Works)shop</a>. Adrian&#8217;s a regular at <a href="http://oggcamp.org/">OggCamp</a> and kindly agreed to sign my copy of his book for me.</p>

<h2>The food</h2>
<p>The food was, as expected, amazing. I&#8217;ve never had bacon and scrambled egg butties that melt in the mouth before. The steak and Guinness casserole for lunch was beyond words. The evening party was sustained with sushi and tasty curry.</p>
<p>Thanks, James!</p>
