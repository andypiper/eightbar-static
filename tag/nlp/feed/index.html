As it went on the amount of time required went up significantly, so rather than the 80 hours total I think I spent more like 1&#38;frac12; times that at over 120 hours!<br /><br />There were four of us at work (that I know of) who embarked on the course but due to the commitment of time I've mentioned above only myself and <a href="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/">Dale</a> finished. &#160;By the way, Dale has written an <a href="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=2162">excellent post on the structure and content of the course</a> so I'd suggest reading his blog for more details on that stuff, there's little point in me re-posting it as he's written such a good summary.<br /><br />In terms of the participants on the course, it seems to have been quite a success for Stanford University - this is the first time they have run courses in this way it seems. &#160;The lecturers gave us some statistics at a couple of strategic points throughout the course and it seems there were around 40,000 people registering an interest, of which around 5000 were watching the lecture material and around 2000 completed the course having taken part in the homework assignments.<br /><br />I'm glad I committed as much as I did. &#160;If I were one of the 5000 just watching the lectures and not doing the homework material I don't think I would have got as much out of it, but the added time required to complete the homework was significant so perhaps there's a trade-off here? &#160;It's certainly the first time I've committed this much of my own personal time (it took over the lives of myself and Dale for quite a few weeks) as I was too busy at work to spend many business hours working on the course so it was all done in evenings and weekends. &#160;That's certainly one piece of feedback I gave at the end of the course, Stanford could make the course timing more flexible but also allow more time for the course to be completed.<br /><br />My experience with the way the assignments were marked was a little different to the way Dale has described in his post. &#160;I was already very familiar with the concepts of test, development and held-out sets (three different sets of data used when training NLP systems) so wasn't surprised to see that the modules in the course didn't necessarily have an exact answer to them or more precisely that the code your wrote to perfectly analyse some data on your local system may not get full marks as it was marked against a different data set. &#160;This may seem unfair but is common practice in all NLP system training that I know of.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent course that I'm glad I did. &#160;From what I hear of the other courses, they're not as deeply involved as the NLP course so I may well give another one a go in the future but for now I need to get a little of my life back and have a well earned rest from education. <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/2012/05/27/natural-language-processing-course/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
