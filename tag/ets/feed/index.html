				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scaling things up a little from <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/2009/06/22/a-different-kind-of-tv-remote-control/">my first eightbar post</a>.</p>
<p>This was one of those projects that just sort of &#8220;turned up&#8221;. About 3 weeks ago one of the managers for the ETS department in Hursley got a call from the team building the new IBM Forum in <a href="http://www-05.ibm.com/uk/locations/sbnk.html">IBM South Bank</a>. IBM Forums are locations where IBM can showcase technologies and solutions for customers. The team were looking for a way to control a video wall and a projector to make them show specific videos on request. The requests will come from pedestals known as &#8220;provokers&#8221;, each having a perspex dome holding a thought-provoking item. The initial suggestions had been incredibility expensive and we were asked if we could come up with a solution.</p>
<p><a title="Provoker by hardillb, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardillb/6150090094/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6080/6150090094_170bde8686.jpg" alt="Provoker" width="299" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>The provokers have access to power and an Ethernet connection. Taking all that into account a few ideas came to mind but the best seamed to be an Arduino board with Ethernet support and a button/sensor to trigger the video. There is a relatively new arduino board available that has a <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardEthernet">built in Ethernet</a> shield which seemed perfect for this project. Also, since a number of the items in the provokers would be related to IBM&#8217;s Smarter Planet initiative, it made sense to use <a href="http://mqtt.org">MQTT</a> as a messaging layer as this has been used to implement a number of solutions in this space.</p>
<p><a href="http://knolleary.net/">Nick O&#8217;Leary</a> was enlisted to put together the hardware and also the sketch for the Arduino as he had already written a <a href="http://knolleary.net/arduino-client-for-mqtt/">MQTT client for Arduino</a> in the past.</p>
<p>Each provoker will publish a message containing a playload of &#8220;play&#8221; to a topic like</p>
<p><em>provoker/{n}/action</em></p>
<p>Where &#8216;{n}&#8217; is the unique number identifying which of the 6 provokers sent the message.</p>
<p>To provide some feedback to the guest that pressed the button, the LED has been made to pulse while one of the provoker-specific videos is playing. This is controlled by each provoker subscribing to the following topic</p>
<p><em>provoker/{n}/ack</em></p>
<p>Sending &#8220;play&#8221; to this topic causes the LED pluse, sending &#8220;stop&#8221; turns the LED solid again.</p>
<p>The video wall will be driven by software called Scala InfoChannel which has a scripting interface supporting (among other things) Python. So a short script to subscribe to the &#8216;action&#8217; topics and to publish on on the &#8216;ack&#8217; got the videos changing on demand.</p>
<p>And sat in the middle is an instance of the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/groups/service/html/communityview?communityUuid=d5bedadd-e46f-4c97-af89-22d65ffee070">Really Small Message Broker</a> to tie everything together.</p>

<p>This was also the perfect place to use some of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardillb/6127193305/in/photostream">my new &#8220;MQTT Inside&#8221; stickers</a>.</p>
<p><a title="First sticker deployed by hardillb, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardillb/6143434166/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6189/6143434166_4cf426ac18.jpg" alt="First sticker deployed" width="299" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>This project only used one of the digital channels (for the button) and one of the analogue channels (for the LED) available on the Arduino &#8211; which leaves a lot of room for expansion for these type of devices. I can see them being used for future projects.</p>

<li>Arduino Ethernet</li>
<li>Blue LED Illuminated Button</li>
<li>A single resistor to protect the LED</li>
