				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a while now our CIO Innovate Quick team have been busy on the Torque based Metaverse. As we have explained before this is primarily aimed at having a set of resources we can delve a bit deeper into the code of. The aim is not to create an all encompassing platform, as personally I dont think there ever will need to be an all encompassing one.<br />
The team creating and writing and enhancing what we have has grown recently. This has meant some of the things we were missing, but wanted to put in are now getting done.<br />
The biggest of these just went live, that of object manipulation. We tend to develop the Web 2.0 way and put things out there for people, fellow IBMers, to experiment with and break at will. This principle has been used for lots of things under out Technology Adoption Program(TAP). Applications get floated out under this banner and successful ones get adopted in a more serious fashion.<br />
Torque as a game engine already had a live editing function and interface, but this was only really for the server, not for each client to interact with.<br />
Now we have the start of the ability to create objects from the pallette in real time. The strange thing was that despite having been able to do this as a server for some time I felt different rezzing and moving an object as an avatar. I knew that I missed the ability to do this, having been spoilt in that sense by Second Life, but to be able to enter a world and just Rez, even if you are not going to do it all the time seems to have a different psychological impact (at least on me!) to more static virtual worlds where it is merely your participation that is allowed.<br />
Of course as soon as you can create then a power mad spark fires up and you want to build lots of things, more and better. However for now we are able to investigate what this will mean for our colleagues entering this environment, for a comfort factor and then move to start to examine the business value to creation and manipulation in our own environment.<br />

So yes this is not a complex business object that we are interacting with, but I was able to build this live (from the objects we have) and so that is an interesting start to another part of the journey.</p>
