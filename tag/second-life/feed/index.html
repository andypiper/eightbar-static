				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dave Kamalsky of Linden Lab (formerly of IBM Almaden) pinged me to point out that they now have a new blog called <a href="https://blogs.secondlife.com/community/grid">Working Inworld</a>. Now, I wouldnâ€™t usually repost this kind of thing, but one particular post that caught my eye was <a href="https://blogs.secondlife.com/community/grid/blog/2009/02/27/as-seen-on-cnbc-new-ibm-case-study-showcases-value-of-meeting-inworld">the joint IBM / Linden Lab case study on the IBM Academy of Technology events that were held in Second Life</a>. Itâ€™s a very nice <a href="http://secondlifegrid.net.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/Second_Life_Case_IBM.pdf">paper</a>, worth taking a look at for some of the figures and business aspects around how best to make use of these kinds of spaces.</p>
<p>Oh, and thereâ€™s an interesting concluding comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>After holding the Virtual World Conference and the Annual General Meeting in Second Life, the AoT agrees that virtual worlds will have a big impact on business, on IBM, and IBMâ€™s clients. And, the best way to learn about virtual worlds is to use them &#8211; which IBM is now committed to doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This made me smileâ€¦ no kiddingâ€¦ some of us have been around in this space for <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/2006/04/04/well-it-got-my-attention-second-life/">quite a few years</a> nowâ€¦ in fact, I was reminiscing about my avatarâ€™s <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/2007/01/10/bbc-newsnight-gets-deeper-into-our-virtual-personas/">brief TV appearance in an in-world business meeting 2 years ago</a>, only the other day <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>We don&#8217;t usually &#8220;do&#8221; press releases on eightbar, but this one is particularly interesting as it develops from trends we&#8217;ve talked about here for a long time, and has potential connections to both Second Life and OpenSim. More integration of the 3D Internet / virtual worlds into the enterprise.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ann Marie Shillito from <a href="http://anarkik3d.co.uk/">Anarkik 3D</a> visited the eightbar crowd in Hursley (thanks to epred for inviting a bunch of us hangers-on along!).</p>
<p>Anarkik are involved with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology">haptic</a> input devices and have developed some really nice software which enables users to interact with virtual worlds and 3D modelling tools using a consumer-priced haptic controller which can be connected to a PC via USB.</p>
<p>The demo blew us away. First we had a look at how the controller could be used to drive an avatar in a virtual world (in this case, OpenSim). It&#8217;s a considerably more natural way to navigate than the keyboard and mouse setup that is provided with most 3D worlds and should lead to a lot more accessibility into these environments. The part that really impressed us was the capability of driving a CAD-like tool called <a href="http://anarkikangels.co.uk/cre8.aspx">Cre8</a> &#8211; a free download from Anarkik, for people who have the controller &#8211; to easily create three-dimensional objects by physical manipulation&#8230; both inside and out. I remember hacking around with an old 3D package called Euclid on my RISC OS machine back in the early 90s and it was a nightmare &#8211; this was sheer joy. Watch the video to see various people playing around with the haptic controller <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<div align="center"><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/0n2_XtrMoIA&#038;ap=%2526fmt%3D18"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/0n2_XtrMoIA&#038;ap=%2526fmt%3D18" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></div>
<p>Just to explain what is going on in the video, as it may not be entirely clear! The demos use a <a href="http://home.novint.com/">Novint Falcon</a> gaming controller. To quote Anarkik, it is &#8220;like a small grounded &#8216;robot&#8217; and provides the &#8216;force feedback&#8217; that gives the uncanny sense of touching a virtual object. This device replaces the mouse and also provides more natural and coherent movement in 3 dimensions.&#8221; At the start, several of us have a go with the controller to drive an avatar around an OpenSim island running on the local machine, using Anarkik&#8217;s software. Around the middle of the video, we switch to using the Cre8 tool to do some simple modelling. In particular, we change the surface hardness of a sphere (where it becomes more or less soft to the touch); and then go inside the sphere and extrude the shape by pulling the controller around. Finally, there&#8217;s a brief look at some fabricated items modelled using the same software.</p>
<p>Anarkik also have a community called <a href="http://anarkikangels.co.uk/">Anarkik Angels</a> where they are looking for supporters to help crowdsource and develop the project.</p>
<p>[the one <em>minor</em> disappointment for me personally was the current lack of Mac OS X support &#8211; Windows-only at the moment &#8211; and the websites aren&#8217;t terribly Mac-friendly either. Guess it&#8217;s time to buy a Windows box just for this stuff, it&#8217;s awesome!]</p>
<p>All of this haptic craziness hit a lot of our interest areas &#8211; 3d printing, new ways of interacting with technology, the application of these kinds of controls to education, manufacturing, science, craft, modelling&#8230; we had some very exciting and interesting discussions and I think several of us are looking forward to playing with this technology a lot more in the future. There are a bunch of <a href="http://anarkikangels.co.uk/VideoGallery.aspx">additional videos on the Anarkik website</a>.</p>
