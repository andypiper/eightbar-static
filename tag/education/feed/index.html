				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/ml/small-icon.hover.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/ml/small-icon.hover.png" /></a></div>Enough time has passed since I undertook the Stanford University <a href="http://gibbalog.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/natural-language-processing-course.html">Natural Language Processing Course</a>&nbsp;for me to forget just how much hard work it was for me to start all over again. &nbsp;This year I decided to have a go at the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">coursera</a>&nbsp;Machine Learning Course.<br /><br />Unlike the 12 week NLP course last year which estimated 10 hours a week and turned out to be more like 15-20 hours a week, this course was much more realistic in estimation at 10 weeks of 8 hours. &nbsp;I think I more or less hit the mark on that point spending about 1 day every week for the past 10 weeks studying machine learning - so around half the time required for the NLP course.<br /><br />The course was written and presented by <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/">Andrew Ng</a>&nbsp;who seems to be rather prolific and somewhat of an academic star in his fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. &nbsp;He is one of the co-founders of the coursera site which along with their main rival, <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a>, have brought about the popular rise of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">Massive Open Online Learning</a>.<br /><br />The Machine Learning Course followed the same format as the NLP course from last year which I can only assume is the standard coursera format, at least for technical courses anyway. &nbsp;Each week there were 1 or two main topic areas to study which were presented in a series of videos featuring Andrew talking through a set of slides on which he's able to hand write notes for demonstration purposes, just as if you're sitting in a real lecture hall at university. &nbsp;To check your understanding of the content of the videos there are questions which must be answered on each topic against which you're graded. &nbsp;The second main component each week is a programming exercise which for the Machine Learning Course must be completed in Octave - so yet another programming language to add to your list. &nbsp;Achieving a mark of 80% or above across all the questions and programming exercises results in a course pass. &nbsp;I appear to have done that with relative ease for this course.<br /><br />The 18 topics covered were:<br /><br /><ul><li>Introduction</li><li>Linear Regression with One Variable</li><li>Linear Algebra Review</li><li>Linear Regression with Multiple Variables</li><li>Octave Tutorial</li><li>Logistic Regression</li><li>Regularisation</li><li>Neural Networks Representation</li><li>Neural Networks Learning</li><li>Advice for Applying Machine Learning</li><li>Machine Learning System Design</li><li>Support Vector Machines</li><li>Clustering</li><li>Dimensionality Reduction</li><li>Anomaly Detection</li><li>Recommender Systems</li><li>Large Scale Machine Learning</li><li>Application Example Photo OCR</li></ul>The course served as a good revision of some maths I haven't used in quite some time, lots of Linear Algebra for which you need a pretty good understanding and lots of calculus which you didn't really need to understand if all you care about is implementing the algorithms rather than working out how they're derived or proven. &nbsp;Being quite maths based, the course used matrices and vectorisation very heavily rather than using the loop structures that most of us would use as a go-to framework for writing complex algorithms. &nbsp;Again, this was some good revision as I've not programmed in this fashion for quite some time. &nbsp;You're definitely reminded of just how efficient you can make complex tasks on modern processors if you stand back from your algorithm for a bit and work out how best to utilise the hardware (via the appropriately optimised libraries) you have.<br /><br />The major thought behind the course seems to be to teach as many different algorithms as possible. &nbsp;There really is a great range. &nbsp;Starting of simply with linear algorithms and progressing right up to the current state-of-the-art Neural Networks and the ever fashionable map-reduce stuff.<br /><br />I didn't find the course terribly difficult, I'm no expert in any of the topics but have studied enough maths not to struggle with that side of things and don't struggle with programming either. &nbsp;I didn't need to use the forums or any of the other social elements offered during the course so I don't really have a feel for how others found the course. &nbsp;I can certainly imagine someone finding it a real struggle if they don't have a particularly deep background in either maths or programming.<br /><br />There was, as far as I can think right now, one (or maybe two depending on how you count) omission from the course. &nbsp;Most of the programming exercises were heavily frameworked for you in advance, you just have to fill in the gaps. &nbsp;This is great for learning the various different algorithms presented during the course but does leave a couple of areas at the end of the course you're not so confident with (aside from not really having a wide grasp of the Octave programming language). &nbsp;The omission of which I speak is that of storing and bootstrapping the models you've trained with the algorithm. &nbsp;All the exercises concentrated on training a model, storing it in memory, using it and as the program terminates then so your model disappears. &nbsp;It would have been great to have another module on the best ways to persist models between program runs, and how to continue training (bootstrap) a model that you have already persisted. &nbsp;I'll feed that thought back to Andrew when the opportunity arises over the next couple of weeks.<br /><br />The problem going forward wont so much be applying what has been offered here but working out what to apply it to. &nbsp;The range of problems that can be tackled with these techniques is mind-blowing, just look at the rise of analytics we're seeing in all areas of business and technology.<br /><br />Overall then, a really nice introduction into the world of machine learning. &nbsp;Recommended!<br /><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

Of course, there was the obligatory wining and dining in the evening which just went to make the experience all the more pleasurable.<br /><br />I really hope to be able to talk a lot more about things we're doing with the university in the future. &nbsp;Until then, I'm looking forward to going back a little more often and potentially imparting some words (of wisdom?) to some students too.]]></content:encoded>

As it went on the amount of time required went up significantly, so rather than the 80 hours total I think I spent more like 1&#38;frac12; times that at over 120 hours!<br /><br />There were four of us at work (that I know of) who embarked on the course but due to the commitment of time I've mentioned above only myself and <a href="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/">Dale</a> finished. &#160;By the way, Dale has written an <a href="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=2162">excellent post on the structure and content of the course</a> so I'd suggest reading his blog for more details on that stuff, there's little point in me re-posting it as he's written such a good summary.<br /><br />In terms of the participants on the course, it seems to have been quite a success for Stanford University - this is the first time they have run courses in this way it seems. &#160;The lecturers gave us some statistics at a couple of strategic points throughout the course and it seems there were around 40,000 people registering an interest, of which around 5000 were watching the lecture material and around 2000 completed the course having taken part in the homework assignments.<br /><br />I'm glad I committed as much as I did. &#160;If I were one of the 5000 just watching the lectures and not doing the homework material I don't think I would have got as much out of it, but the added time required to complete the homework was significant so perhaps there's a trade-off here? &#160;It's certainly the first time I've committed this much of my own personal time (it took over the lives of myself and Dale for quite a few weeks) as I was too busy at work to spend many business hours working on the course so it was all done in evenings and weekends. &#160;That's certainly one piece of feedback I gave at the end of the course, Stanford could make the course timing more flexible but also allow more time for the course to be completed.<br /><br />My experience with the way the assignments were marked was a little different to the way Dale has described in his post. &#160;I was already very familiar with the concepts of test, development and held-out sets (three different sets of data used when training NLP systems) so wasn't surprised to see that the modules in the course didn't necessarily have an exact answer to them or more precisely that the code your wrote to perfectly analyse some data on your local system may not get full marks as it was marked against a different data set. &#160;This may seem unfair but is common practice in all NLP system training that I know of.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent course that I'm glad I did. &#160;From what I hear of the other courses, they're not as deeply involved as the NLP course so I may well give another one a go in the future but for now I need to get a little of my life back and have a well earned rest from education. <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/2012/05/27/natural-language-processing-course/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Behind-the-scenes documentaries, like <a title="Doctor Who Confidential on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_Confidential" >Doctor Who Confidential</a>, matter. They matter because they show viewers, in particular children still deciding what to do with their lives, that it takes more to produce a high-class TV programme than just a few actors who become famous. It shows what other creative and/or technical jobs there are in television.</p>
<p>A couple of weekends ago, we went to the <a title="Doctor Who Official Convention website" href="http://dwconvention.com/" >Doctor Who Official Convention</a> (<a title="#dwcuk Twitter search" href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23dwcuk" >#dwcuk</a>) in Cardiff. While one of the three main panels featured the three stars, Matt Smith, Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill (along with executive producers Stephen Moffat and Caroline Skinner), most of the other scheduled events were focused on how Doctor Who is made.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2024" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/dwc-danny-snow-300x200.jpg" alt="dwc-danny-snow" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>At the very start of the day, we went to see Danny Hargreaves <del>blow things up</del> talk about the Special Effects on Doctor Who. In his Q&amp;A session (after making it snow indoors), the first question asked was &#8220;How did you get into special effects work?&#8221; and, between questions like how he blew up the Torchwood Hub and how he makes the Doctor&#8217;s hands and head fiery during a regeneration, a later question was &#8220;When did you realise you wanted to work in special effects?&#8221;. Attendees were interested not just in the fictional stories and characters but in how the programme is made and the interesting careers they might not otherwise have come across.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2025" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2012-03-24-14.26.38-179x300.jpg" alt="2012-03-24 14.26.38" width="179" height="300" /></p>
<p>Throughout the day, I heard audience members ask how to become costume and prosthetics designers and how to become script writers. Danny described how his team designs and creates the effects, assess the risks of blowing things up, and who they work with to make it all happen. He also explained how he came to be a trainee in the nascent world of special effects before studying Mechanical Engineering so that he could build the devices they need for Doctor Who (and the other shows he&#8217;s worked on, like Coronation Street). Directors of photography, set designers, executive producers, writers, and directors went on to talk about what their own jobs entailed day-to-day and how it all comes together to make an episode of Doctor Who.</p>
<p>These discussions continued the story that used to be told after each new episode of Doctor Who by Doctor Who Confidential on BBC3. Doctor Who Confidential started in 2005 with the return of Doctor Who. As well as talking about some interesting perspective on making that night&#8217;s episode of Doctor Who, it featured interviews with, and &#8216;day-in-the-life&#8217; documentaries about, the actors (including showing the less glamorous side of shivering in tents and quilted coats between takes), the casting directors, the producers, the writers, the choreographers, the costume designers, the special effects supervisors, the monster designers, the prosthetics experts, the directors, the assistant directors, and many, many others. It also held competitions for children to write a mini episode and then see the process of making it, which would&#8217;ve been an amazing experience!</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/pkTSoigcM08?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Yes, it took a slightly odd turn in the last series when it turned a bit Top Gear by showing Karen Gillan having a driving lesson and Arthur Darvill swimming with sharks; possibly a misguided attempt to increase its popularity before it got canned anyway to cut costs.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a real shame to lose Doctor Who Confidential and its insights into the skill, hard work, and opportunities in TV and film production.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week saw the start of a new year for IBM Hursley&#8217;s MentorPlace programme. The idea of MentorPlace is to connect people from the lab with female students from local schools who might be interested in pursuing a career in one of the STEM areas (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). We work with the girls over the course of the year, providing a weekly email mentoring session, and run some activities on-site to build up their knowledge of different topics and work together in teams. The idea of engaging more with students to help them to learn more about technology and careers is something I&#8217;m personally passionate about, and <a href="http://andypiper.co.uk/2011/09/12/teaching-technology-in-the-future-raspberry-pi/">I wrote about it on my own blog last week</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a lot of fun, and I think the people from the lab get as much out of it as the girls do! Last week&#8217;s activities at Hursley saw 48 students learn some Java coding in the morning, and in the afternoon to build bridges using paper, string, tape, and craft sticks &#8211; they had to support a number of text books in order to be successful. The girls were divided into teams named after different inspirational women in science, technology and other areas of achievement. Here are some of the resulting pieces of work:</p>

<p>All of the bridges performed to the required specification and it was left to the judges to decide which one was the most creative and successful design &#8211; tough job! Looking forward to working with the schools during the academic year&#8230;</p>
