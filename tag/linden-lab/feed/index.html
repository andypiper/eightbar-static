				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dave Kamalsky of Linden Lab (formerly of IBM Almaden) pinged me to point out that they now have a new blog called <a href="https://blogs.secondlife.com/community/grid">Working Inworld</a>. Now, I wouldnâ€™t usually repost this kind of thing, but one particular post that caught my eye was <a href="https://blogs.secondlife.com/community/grid/blog/2009/02/27/as-seen-on-cnbc-new-ibm-case-study-showcases-value-of-meeting-inworld">the joint IBM / Linden Lab case study on the IBM Academy of Technology events that were held in Second Life</a>. Itâ€™s a very nice <a href="http://secondlifegrid.net.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/Second_Life_Case_IBM.pdf">paper</a>, worth taking a look at for some of the figures and business aspects around how best to make use of these kinds of spaces.</p>
<p>Oh, and thereâ€™s an interesting concluding comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>After holding the Virtual World Conference and the Annual General Meeting in Second Life, the AoT agrees that virtual worlds will have a big impact on business, on IBM, and IBMâ€™s clients. And, the best way to learn about virtual worlds is to use them &#8211; which IBM is now committed to doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This made me smileâ€¦ no kiddingâ€¦ some of us have been around in this space for <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/2006/04/04/well-it-got-my-attention-second-life/">quite a few years</a> nowâ€¦ in fact, I was reminiscing about my avatarâ€™s <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/2007/01/10/bbc-newsnight-gets-deeper-into-our-virtual-personas/">brief TV appearance in an in-world business meeting 2 years ago</a>, only the other day <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
