<p><a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/flashyduck300x225.jpg"><img title="flashyduck-300x225" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: block; border-left-width: 0px; float: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-right-width: 0px" height="225" alt="flashyduck-300x225" src="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/flashyduck300x225-thumb.jpg" width="300" border="0" /></a> </p>
<p>Many eightbar readers may have received one of those gadget catalogues you get through the door, with weird and wonderful widgets to ostensibly help with everyday life. “How have I ever coped without a Wifi Fondue set?” and similar thoughts may have run your mind. However, one thing these catalogues aim to promise is the integration of technology into everyday life; the dream that if technology is pervasive enough, it could remove all those little annoyances that we experience: forgetting a recipe, not knowing when our friends are turning up at the pub, having to get up twice to make a cup of tea, and so on… missing a phone call, because the phone is not loud enough, or set to vibrate, or other such vagaries of the modern telecommunications device. If only one could make a normally unobtrusive device that would alert one to a phone call, or a doorbell, or a new email, in fact pretty much anything!</p>
<p>Back in January I made some <a href="http://mqtt.org/">MQTT</a> ducks. The aim was to make them flash on or off when receiving signals from my Ubuntu server.</p>
<p>Now, you may wonder why I would want 20 rubber ducks to flash when my phone goes off. Well, this was about the same time as I decided I wanted to make a unobtrusive alerting device. There is no scientific or technical reason in itself. I just had a Mini Cooper&#8217;s worth of rubber ducks sitting around, unemployed. Therefore I designed a simple project to get to grips with the world of Arduinos not only educating me but also putting the lazy mallards to use. I found some cheap fairylights just before Christmas and had the aforementioned large supply of rubber ducks (as you do). </p>
<p><b>Components</b></p>
<ul>
<li>1 x Freeduino </li>
<li>1 x 20 LED Fairy lights (£3) </li>
<li>1 x USB Printer Cable (via theattick.tv)</li>
<li>20 x Rubber Ducks </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img-51451.jpg"><img title="IMG_5145" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-bottom: 0px" height="160" alt="IMG_5145" src="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img-5145-thumb1.jpg" width="240" border="0" /></a> </p>
<p><b>Tools</b></p>
<ul>
<li>GlueGun (£1.50 from Woolworths during the closing down sale) </li>
<li>Scissors </li>
</ul>
<p>The construction was very simple. Making a small hole in the bottom of each duck, I inserted an LED and glue gunned it into place. I checked the effect with the batteries to see the result.</p>
<p><a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/10977431.jpg"><img title="1097743" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-bottom: 0px" height="180" alt="1097743" src="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/1097743-thumb1.jpg" width="240" border="0" /></a> </p>
<p>Removing the battery component with a pair of scissors and stripping the wire coating revealed the multi-core ends. These were plugged into the digital pin thirteen and the digital ground on the Arduino. To confirm the wires were plugged into the correct pin I pressed the reset button. The ducks and LED thirteen on the Arduino would then quickly flash.</p>
<p><a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img-5148.jpg"><img title="IMG_5148" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: block; border-left-width: 0px; float: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-right-width: 0px" height="240" alt="IMG_5148" src="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img-5148-thumb.jpg" width="360" border="0" /></a> </p>
<p>Coding for Arduinos is very basic. The program I wrote received a 1 or a 0 down the USB cable. When it received a 1 (49 in ASCII) it turned the ducks on. When it received a 0 (48 in ASCII) it turned them off.</p>
<pre>int LEDPin  = 13;
int inByte =0;

void setup() {
    pinMode(LEDPin,OUTPUT);
    Serial.begin(9600);
}
void loop(){
    if (Serial.available() &gt; 0) {
      inByte = Serial.read();
      Serial.print(inByte);
    }
    if (inByte == 49 ) {
      digitalWrite(LEDPin,HIGH);
    }
    if (inByte == 48 ) {
      digitalWrite(LEDPin,LOW);
    }
}</pre>
<p>To connect this to my <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/rsmb">Really Small Message Broker</a> using MQTT, I modified an excellent &amp; simple Perl script written by Andy Stanford-Clark. His script reads RSMB topics for specific entries. I created a listener that watched for messages being passed on to the Ducks/ topic. If the content of the message was on it sent 1 down the wire to the Arduino, and if it received off it sent 0.</p>
<p>Next move… well someone at <a href="http://www.pachube.com/">Pachube</a> put forward the idea <a href="http://twitter.com/pachube">on Twitter</a> of controlling with their infrastructure. Now, I can send an on or off message to a Pachube feed using Twitter. My server at home then checks this feed every 15 seconds for any changes and sends a message to my RSMB as required.</p>
<p>Thanks to the guys from <b><a href="http://greatduckcaper.com/">http://greatduckcaper.com/</a></b> for providing their leftover ducks and theAttick.tv for providing the USB cable!</p>
