Of course, there was the obligatory wining and dining in the evening which just went to make the experience all the more pleasurable.<br /><br />I really hope to be able to talk a lot more about things we're doing with the university in the future. &nbsp;Until then, I'm looking forward to going back a little more often and potentially imparting some words (of wisdom?) to some students too.]]></content:encoded>
