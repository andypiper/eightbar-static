<p align="center">Just an average day in the Hursley tea bar!</p>
<p>Martin Dix from <a href="http://currentcost.co.uk">CurrentCost</a> visited to deliver a bunch of meters for people who had attended <a href="http://homecamp.org.uk">Home Camp</a> 08. Whilst he was with us, Andy Stanford-Clark hooked up a (battery-powered) meter to one of his mousetraps to show how it is possible to detect traps going off using the meter &#8211; this is the same technique he uses in his automated home system. He also showed the same message arriving in his MQTT broker on his Ubuntu laptop. The table was soon awash with gadgets, wires and tools. I brought along a camera or two, Dale brought along some questions about the software internals of the new devices, and a great time was had by a bunch of geeks over tea&#8230;</p>
<p>No mice were harmed during this meetup, but a few wooden coffee stirrers were put through their paces in some vicious mousetraps.</p>
