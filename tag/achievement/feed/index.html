				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[A guest post by Hursley’s <a href="http://benfletcher.com">Ben Fletcher</a>. This was originally written as an internal blog post – Ben recently received the award for External Honours at the IBM Corporate Technical Recognition Event. Here, he reflects on his experiences] </p>
<p>I believe it is important to leave it entirely up to the individual to recognise the positives of IBMers they work with, and go from there &#8211; you can&#8217;t do any better than this, but, there&#8217;s a bonus: sometimes IBM wants to recognise you too!&#160; To make it all look good, to customers, or to make people happy, and to maintain the technical and innovative reputation or brand IBM has, they&#8217;ve built title names or award names as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>IBM Fellows</li>
<li>Corporate and Patent Portfolio Awards</li>
<li>Distinguished Engineers</li>
<li>Members of the IBM Academy of Technology</li>
<li>External Honours</li>
<li>Major Outstanding Innovation and Major Outstanding Technical Achievement Awards </li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of different names, but of course IBM is so diverse that it&#8217;s difficult to recognise things in a systematic manner. Looking at the titles, I think the key points here are: if you love corporate technology and/or innovation, you can&#8217;t go any better! </p>
<p>I did.&#160; As a result, I fell under the External Honours category, primarily for the <a href="http://www.radar.org.uk/awards-2009/winners-2008.aspx">RADAR Young Person of the Year award</a> that I received last year.&#160; Thereby I got into the book and, more excitedly, to meet other people and learn more about IBM.&#160; What did I learn from the other IBM attendees? </p>
<p>I would firstly ask where do you work?&#160; If it&#8217;s GBS [IBM Global Business Services], I would ask if they&#8217;ve heard of SWG [IBM Software Group]?&#160; If yes, have they worked with SWG before?&#160; With either answer, I would then ask if they&#8217;ve heard of Lab Services [which is where I work].&#160; With these answers, I started coming up with questions I&#8217;d love answers to &#8211; for example: </p>
<ul>
<li>how to improve the awareness of what Lab Services can do, across into GBS?</li>
<li>does the linkage between Lab Services and GBS have any room for improvement?</li>
<li>have people from Lab Services moved to GBS?</li>
<li>is Research well connected with UK?&#160; With Research being in Switzerland?</li>
<li>is the market for deaf-related and/or blind-related technology too small to be of interest?</li>
</ul>

<p>I also met with Brendon Riley [the IBM UK General Manager], who I was very keen to talk with, particularly as my wife is also Australian.&#160; I was thrilled when he told me that he was from Perth &#8211; where my wife was from! Brendon very kindly took the opportunity to ask me to do something for him &#8211; clearly he was keen to demonstrate that the planet was flatter, as he could ask me directly like a colleague sitting at the next desk might, rather than passing the request down through a hierarchical organisation. The fact that he&#8217;s from Perth, my wife&#8217;s from Perth, the Country General Manager asking me directly to do something for him, as our CEO would say: the world is becoming smaller and flatter! </p>
