				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An event that has ignited competitive passions at Hursley for a number of years is the annual <a href="http://www.facebook.com/HursleyQDG">Quad-Department Games</a> (previously known as the Tri-Department Games). Each year, the Barbarians, Hatters, Mavericks and Titans compete in a series of events with a rolling aggregated scoreboard. It is not just about outdoor sports, although the running, football and touch rugby are major parts of the calendar&#8230; the departments can also demonstrate their prowess in a cake bake, in a quiz, or at table football. It&#8217;s a lot of fun <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s event was a running race around Hursley Park. On a brilliant, sunny and clear November day, a total of 57 runners completed a 5km course. There are a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andypiper/sets/72157628011837331/">couple</a> of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/currie/sets/72157628137213424/">sets of photos</a> on Flickr, but here are some highlights&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/xblogo.gif"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1060" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="xblogo" src="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/xblogo.gif" alt="Extreme Blue logo" width="150" height="102" /></a>Extreme Blue is IBM&#8217;s summer intern scheme. Students can <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/employment/us/extremeblue/">apply to IBM</a> to be part of the scheme and those lucky enough to be selected are brought into various IBM locations worldwide to be mentored by IBM staff who have proposed an idea and small project for them to work on.</p>
<p>This morning I went along to listen to what the 16 students in the UK have been doing with their summer. These students were split into four groups of four, working on projects for an improved voting system, a smart cursor, smarter vehicles and FTP discovery.</p>
<p>You know you&#8217;re getting old when all the students seem rather young, I think &#8220;green&#8221; is the term people used to use when I was starting in IBM, they do remind me of my early days at work. However, they all presented themselves beautifully, spoke very well using slick rehearsed presentations they&#8217;ve put a lot of effort into, and (barring one or two stutters) seemed entirely confident in what they were doing up at the front of what must seem an intimidating auditorium full of knowledgeable IBM professionals. They handled questions well too, I don&#8217;t necessarily have to agree with all the answers, but the way they each went about receiving the questions and providing thoughtful answers was good.</p>
<p>Each team had 7 minutes to present their 12 weeks&#8217; work with every person in the team getting a chance to pitch in at some point, so they didn&#8217;t get very long to put their projects across. The audience were asked to keep questions until the end of the pitch, which allowed them to flow easily through their material. The range of presentations was interesting, some chose to manually click through PowerPoint-style, while other groups came up with stories or monologuing through a video they had created. This range kept the audience interested with each style of presentation being effective for its purpose.</p>
<p>It was interesting to see how each of the projects has been clearly influenced by the four members of the team. Each team of four contained one business student and three technical students, and the range of skills came through in the presentations. Some groups had &#8220;deep-dived&#8221; straight into technical work while others had spent more time thinking about use cases, business cases, how their project might fit in with IBM or be sold. I suspect this has a direct relationship to both how the team was lead by the IBM staff but also by the particular characters of each team and reminded me of Myers-Briggs or Belbin style studies I&#8217;ve done in the past.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;ll have a little look at each project in (very) brief&#8230; I&#8217;ll stress in advance that I&#8217;ve heard a small snippet of 12 weeks of hard work and any opinion here is mine alone and based solely on today&#8217;s pitches:</p>
<p><strong>Improved voting system</strong><br />
The team gave an introduction to their solution involving a three phase voting system followed by an example of the problem they were trying to solve and how their solution tackled these. The team had been working with a local council to identify requirements for such a system, so were able to work with real-world examples and solicit feedback. Questions followed and feedback from the council seemed to have been good. Some doubts were expressed by the audience about the security of such a system which whilst possibly valid, it seemed to me that these could be addressed should the solution be implemented live. The team presented the solution as having environmental benefits which might seem obvious at first but I thought were rather questionable given the requirement to use computer hardware and power, a further study would be required here to determine whether the current system using sustainably-sourced paper could be bettered on the environmental front. Verification of voters appears to be vastly improved using their system with less room from fraudulent votes with connection to other systems for authentication such as the DVLA. Clearly any such automated voting system would have huge benefits for the speed of counting after voting has completed.</p>
<p><strong>Smart Cursor</strong><br />
A new input device to control an on screen cursor using any sort of body movement aimed at improving human-computer interaction (primarily for disabled people). The system involves a hardware sensor strapped to the part of the body that has movement. Initial calibration for any new part of the body is required which is run once to set up 4 movements (up/down/left/right). Other movements and gestures would also be possible such as a mouse click and the combination of sensors on multiple parts of the body. The hardware technology could be built small enough to be permanently wearable without distress or difficulty to the user. Other uses of the technology appear to be for rehabilitation or monitoring a condition whilst wearing the hardware device. Lots of room for customisation brought out during questioning as well as a few issues about how to set up the device in the first place. However, this seemed like a really worthwhile (if low usage) piece of research that could be immensely useful to its target audience and at low cost too.</p>
<p><strong>Smarter Vehicles</strong><br />
The aim of this project is to personalise the driving experience for car users by attempting to add three things to a car (1) identifying which user is driving, (2) providing the car with knowledge about where it&#8217;s going, and (3) permanently connecting the car to a network. The team used a video style presentation and monologue they had story-boarded which was clearly well produced and rehearsed. It was unclear what the project had achieved, however, as no specifics were mentioned on what had been achieved but there were certainly plenty of good ideas as to what could be done in this area. The team do appear to have a demonstration available which I&#8217;m looking forward to going to see in Hursley tomorrow and the Extreme Blue demonstration expo after which I&#8217;m sure it will be a lot clearer which ideas they&#8217;ve followed through into something tangible and which are still in progress. Another great plus for this team was they were aligned with an automotive manufacturer and will be presenting their ideas back to the board at a later date which will be a fabulous experience to get for them all.</p>
<p><strong>FTP Discovery</strong><br />
Tackles the problem of escalating FTP network complexity in enterprises. The project attempts to map FTP files on the network in flight and automatically provides a visualisation of the network in a node graph style format. This network can be annotated manually with things such adding the cost of various transfers and links to allow the users to build up a visual picture and cost to the company of their FTP services. The team advocate the use of managed file transfers (as provided by <a href="https://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/filetransfer/">WMQ File Transfer Edition</a>, for example) but failed to clearly state what the problem with FTP as a service is. That said, they seem to have a very clever way of detecting FTP traffic by sniffing the network and could easily extend their architecture to include all sorts of other protocols. They have also thought carefully about how their work might be used in the future, for example as a tool for IBM pre-sales, a saleable IBM product or (most likely) a component of one or more existing IBM products.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all the teams and people involved. The presentations were great, a very entertaining hour, and it seems like some really useful work has come out of Extreme Blue in the UK again this year. Well done!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As with yesterday&#8217;s post, I really don&#8217;t have to do too much work on this one, as the detail has already been written up elsewhere&#8230;</p>
<p>If you watched this week&#8217;s edition of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bang/">Bang Goes The Theory on BBC1</a>, you will have seen <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/about/nick-oleary/">Nick O&#8217;Leary</a> and Kevin Brown from IBM Hursley helping Jem and Dallas to drive taxis. That probably wouldn&#8217;t have been entirely revolutionary, had it not been done through a combination of an Emotiv brain-signal-reading headset, and some MQTT and Arduino funkiness&#8230; no hands on the wheel or feet on the pedals!</p>
<p>Nick has <a href="http://knolleary.net/2010/04/22/how-i-got-onto-prime-time-bbc-one/">a great write-up</a> of what sounds like a fun (but cold) event. You may still be able to catch the fun on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00s5fvq/Bang_Goes_the_Theory_Can_You_Train_Your_Brain/">iPlayer</a>, or there are <a href="http://www.criticalmention.com/report/5093x135035.htm">some clips over here</a>.</p>

<p>To be fair though, I did end up picking up a free copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0684858398?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=thejumpgate-21&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1634&#038;creative=19450&#038;creativeASIN=0684858398">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=thejumpgate-21&#038;l=as2&#038;o=2&#038;a=0684858398" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, which <a href="http://galem.wordpress.com">Martin</a> has been recommending to me for ages.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a festive entry on eightbar this year, let&#8217;s talk about Christmas lights. Twitter-controlled ones! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/andysc">Andy Stanford-Clark</a> hooked up a set of lights to Twitter. As <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/galleries/239721-8/Happy-Twitter-Christmas.htm">reported in Computer Weekly</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Using some clever IBM middeware, The microcontroller sets the illumination colour based on a signal from the internet or via SMS over a GSM network &#8211; so you can tweet &#8220;ibmlights&#8221; with the word RED, GREEN or BLUE to change their colour.</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, the commands got a bit more sophisticated than that, with more colours and lighting patterns. Towards the middle of last week the lights ended up over <a href="http://twitter.com/lauracowen">Laura</a>&#8216;s desk, and a growing band of folks delightedly tweeted the <a href="http://twitter.com/ibmlights">@ibmlights</a> account with instructions to change colour or pattern. She took some pictures for me (and some video as well, but I didn&#8217;t have time to edit it&#8230;).</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/IMG_4041.JPG"><img alt="" title="" style="max-width: 800px;" src="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/IMG_4041.JPG" width="200" /></a> <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/IMG_4040.JPG"><img alt="" title="" style="max-width: 800px;" src="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/IMG_4040.JPG" width="200" /></a></div>
<p>Another year of innovation and fun at Hursley! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Happy Christmas!</p>
<p>(by the way, well worth taking a look at the <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/galleries/239721-1/Hursley-House.htm">rest of the Computer Weekly article</a> I linked above &#8211; lots more coolness from Hursley! oh, and I&#8217;m not sure how long the lights will be online&#8230; it&#8217;s just a bit of fun really)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/chcalendar.jpg" width="266" height="200" alt="Chinese Calendar" style="float:left; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:10px;" /></p>
<p>Hursley is a culturally as well as a technically diverse place, so we&#8217;ve got some great opportunities to learn from each other. This lunchtime I popped along to one of the events organised by the lab&#8217;s Chinese Connect team, which was all about Understanding the Chinese Calendar (the title of the post refers to a significant date this week in that calendar, September 23rd).</p>
<p>Previous talks in the Chinese Culture series, which is organised by Hursley&#8217;s Jenny He, have covered subjects such as the evolution of the Chinese languages, how to understand Chinese names, and Chinese music and instruments. I&#8217;m embarrassed to say that this is the first of the talks I&#8217;ve been to, despite working here for some time&#8230; I really should take more advantage of the range of activities and opportunities that Hursley has to offer!</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s talk was delivered by Darren Beard, who was particularly interested in the astronomical background to the Chinese calendar (having <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999JBAA..109...70B">published a paper on the same topic</a> several years ago). Darren covered the scientific background of this <i>lunisolar</i> calendar, and the changes that have taken place to it historically over the ~3500 years it has been around &#8211; particularly interesting to me, since I&#8217;m a historian by background. It&#8217;s a complicated system which takes account of 19 year lunar cycles, requires things like leap months, and has a set of rules which specify how it works&#8230; but it is certainly more comprehensible once you understand those aspects. It was interesting to realise just how much my own perceptions of time are based on the calendar system I&#8217;ve grown up with!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[thanks to the brilliant <a href="http://lauracowen.co.uk">Laura Cowen</a>, producer of the <a href="http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org/">Ubuntu UK Podcast</a> and uber UX god at Hursley, for writing up this event â€“ itâ€™s a shame I wasnâ€™t able to make it!]</p>
<p>As is usually the case when I&#8217;m attending a HantsLUG (<a href="http://hants.lug.org.uk">Hampshire Linux User Group</a><a href="http://hants.lug.org.uk)">)</a> meeting, it was a lovely sunny day on Saturday. It&#8217;s like as if it knows that I&#8217;m going to be spending the day inside, geeking in front of a laptop screen. This meeting, however, we put the sun to good use, first of all showing off Hursley Park at its best, and then lunching out on the decking at the Clubhouse.</p>
<p>When I was a more frequent attendee of the HantsLUG bring-a-box meetings (where I installed my first <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> distro, and later my first <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>), I&#8217;d often thought how cool it would be to host a meeting at IBM Hursley. But I never got as far as investigating the security and wifi hassles I&#8217;d have to overcome. Fortunately, <a href="http://www.strangeparty.com/">Anton Piatek</a> was a little braver and sent some emails to nearly the right people (who helpfully forwarded them on to really the right people), and suggested his plan to <a href="http://hants.lug.org.uk/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?AdamTrickett">Adam Trickett</a>, Chair of HantsLUG. Adam says he nearly bit Anton&#8217;s hand off and so it happened.</p>
<p>HantsLUG is one of the biggest LUGs in the UK and is our local Linux user group but has surprisingly never really (in the 7 years I&#8217;ve known them) had a huge amount of interaction with IBM Hursley. For a long time, though, there has been a good pool of Linux skills and interest in the Lab, and over the last couple of years the number of people around the Lab voluntarily using Linux as their desktop OS has risen (as has the number of Ubuntu lanyards to be seen as you walk the corridors of Hursley).</p>

<p>So what makes Hursley a good place for a LUG meeting? Well, for a start, it&#8217;s just a really nice place to be &#8211; and Hursley House as well as the Park are very impressive to show off to visitors <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>On Saturday, we were mostly in the Auditorium (where Spitfires were built during WWII), then when we led everyone down to the Clubhouse for lunch, we took the usual site tour scenic route via the Sunken Garden and fish pond. Although Hursley is out in the country, seemingly the middle of nowhere, it&#8217;s actually on the bus-route from Winchester so we had an excellent turnout of about 30 people. IBM Hursley also has a lot of cool people who do cool things that we can tell people about (although one piece of feedback I heard from a LUG person was that they thought we didn&#8217;t talk enough about what IBM does!).</p>

<p>Although we had the House to ourselves, and everyone was free to stand around and chat in the Main Hall, most of the day revolved around talks in the Auditorium. It all kicked off at 11am with an introduction to IBM Hursley (and, of course, directions to the fire exits and toilets) from Anton. The inimitable <a href="http://www.twitter.com/andysc">Andy Stanford-Clark</a>, fresh from a week of press interviews, enthused everyone till lunchtime with tales of mouse traps, <a href="http://mqtt.org">MQTT</a>, twittering houses, twittering ferries, water meters, and energy monitoring. I say &#8216;enthused&#8217; but there must be a better term to describe the way the audience rushed the stage when Andy offered to sell <a href="http://www.currentcost.com">Current Cost</a> monitors at a discount&#8230;</p>
<p>After lunch, we had a collection of shorter talks on a range of topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>I talked about <a href="http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4042">InfoSlicer</a>, the open source software that my <a href="http://www-05.ibm.com/employment/uk/extreme-blue/">Extreme Blue student team</a> developed last Summer and IBM released under the GPL</li>
<li>Anton described the anatomy of Ubuntu packages (he&#8217;s the guy that provides Ubuntu users in IBM with the flawless packages we&#8217;ve come to rely on)</li>
<li><a href="http://tonywhitmore.co.uk">Tony Whitmore</a> related his experiences of producing the popular <a href="http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org">Ubuntu UK Podcast</a> &#8211; and pimped the upcoming <a href="http://oggcamp.org/">OggCamp unconference</a></li>
<li>Adam Trickett, Chair of HantsLUG, gave out free books in return for promises of book reviews on the HantsLUG wiki</li>
</ul>
<p>Then everyone just hung around chatting for ages.</p>
<p>It was a really enjoyable and relaxed day; kudos to Anton, Stephen, and John for organising it from the IBM end. Thanks also to the IBMers who came along and to the many HantsLUG members who turned up. I&#8217;d say it was a success and we should definitely do it again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[A guest post by Hursleyâ€™s <a href="http://benfletcher.com">Ben Fletcher</a>. This was originally written as an internal blog post â€“ Ben recently received the award for External Honours at the IBM Corporate Technical Recognition Event. Here, he reflects on his experiences] </p>
<p>I believe it is important to leave it entirely up to the individual to recognise the positives of IBMers they work with, and go from there &#8211; you can&#8217;t do any better than this, but, there&#8217;s a bonus: sometimes IBM wants to recognise you too!&#160; To make it all look good, to customers, or to make people happy, and to maintain the technical and innovative reputation or brand IBM has, they&#8217;ve built title names or award names as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>IBM Fellows</li>
<li>Corporate and Patent Portfolio Awards</li>
<li>Distinguished Engineers</li>
<li>Members of the IBM Academy of Technology</li>
<li>External Honours</li>
<li>Major Outstanding Innovation and Major Outstanding Technical Achievement Awards </li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of different names, but of course IBM is so diverse that it&#8217;s difficult to recognise things in a systematic manner. Looking at the titles, I think the key points here are: if you love corporate technology and/or innovation, you can&#8217;t go any better! </p>
<p>I did.&#160; As a result, I fell under the External Honours category, primarily for the <a href="http://www.radar.org.uk/awards-2009/winners-2008.aspx">RADAR Young Person of the Year award</a> that I received last year.&#160; Thereby I got into the book and, more excitedly, to meet other people and learn more about IBM.&#160; What did I learn from the other IBM attendees? </p>
<p>I would firstly ask where do you work?&#160; If it&#8217;s GBS [IBM Global Business Services], I would ask if they&#8217;ve heard of SWG [IBM Software Group]?&#160; If yes, have they worked with SWG before?&#160; With either answer, I would then ask if they&#8217;ve heard of Lab Services [which is where I work].&#160; With these answers, I started coming up with questions I&#8217;d love answers to &#8211; for example: </p>
<ul>
<li>how to improve the awareness of what Lab Services can do, across into GBS?</li>
<li>does the linkage between Lab Services and GBS have any room for improvement?</li>
<li>have people from Lab Services moved to GBS?</li>
<li>is Research well connected with UK?&#160; With Research being in Switzerland?</li>
<li>is the market for deaf-related and/or blind-related technology too small to be of interest?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/image1.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/image_thumb1.png" width="240" height="192" /></a></p>
<p>I also met with Brendon Riley [the IBM UK General Manager], who I was very keen to talk with, particularly as my wife is also Australian.&#160; I was thrilled when he told me that he was from Perth &#8211; where my wife was from! Brendon very kindly took the opportunity to ask me to do something for him &#8211; clearly he was keen to demonstrate that the planet was flatter, as he could ask me directly like a colleague sitting at the next desk might, rather than passing the request down through a hierarchical organisation. The fact that he&#8217;s from Perth, my wife&#8217;s from Perth, the Country General Manager asking me directly to do something for him, as our CEO would say: the world is becoming smaller and flatter! </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday lunchtime the auditorium in Hursley House became the venue of an internal &#8220;unconference&#8221; of sorts &#8211; a very relaxed session with a bunch of short, snappy 5 minute presentations by folks from around the lab who related their experiences from different tech conferences.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/dalelane">Dale Lane</a> spoke about Hackdays and Barcamps; <a href="http://twitter.com/aefaradien">Alex Hutter</a> talked about last weekend&#8217;s Barcamp in Brighton; <a href="http://twitter.com/rewbs">Robin Fernandes</a> talked about user groups and his involvement with PHP; <a href="http://twitter.com/iaingavin">Iain Gavin</a> from Amazon Web Services told us about external views on IBM; and <a href="http://twitter.com/andysc">Andy Stanford-Clark</a> was, well, Andy <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I think he may have mentioned something about some service called Twitter, I was&#8217;t really paying attention&#8230; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Most of it was Ignite-style high-speed babble, and mostly without slides.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andypiper/3901150474/" title="Unlunch, unlearn by andyp uk, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2545/3901150474_079fe02e9d_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Unlunch, unlearn" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andypiper/3901150474/" title="Unlunch, unlearn by andyp uk, on Flickr"><br /></a>
</div>
<p>It was all the brainchild of the brilliant <a href="http://twitter.com/zoe_slattery">Zoe Slattery</a>, who also had some exciting announcements to share with us (more to come on these once I get clearance to post!). There were guest appearances of photographs by <a href="http://twitter.com/alicebartlett">Alice</a>, too.</p>
<p>Oh, and my contribution? I gave a potted, high-speed history of eightbar from the perspective of someone who jumped in to the Hursley world from the outside. Here&#8217;s a pictorial tour. You&#8217;ll note few mentions of virtual worlds &#8211; not because that&#8217;s not something eightbar does anymore, but rather to remind people of the breadth of our interests. Oh, and guess what, the blog has been around for nearly 4 years &#8211; just a week or so to go!</p>
