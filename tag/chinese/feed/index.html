<p>Hursley is a culturally as well as a technically diverse place, so we&#8217;ve got some great opportunities to learn from each other. This lunchtime I popped along to one of the events organised by the lab&#8217;s Chinese Connect team, which was all about Understanding the Chinese Calendar (the title of the post refers to a significant date this week in that calendar, September 23rd).</p>
<p>Previous talks in the Chinese Culture series, which is organised by Hursley&#8217;s Jenny He, have covered subjects such as the evolution of the Chinese languages, how to understand Chinese names, and Chinese music and instruments. I&#8217;m embarrassed to say that this is the first of the talks I&#8217;ve been to, despite working here for some time&#8230; I really should take more advantage of the range of activities and opportunities that Hursley has to offer!</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s talk was delivered by Darren Beard, who was particularly interested in the astronomical background to the Chinese calendar (having <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999JBAA..109...70B">published a paper on the same topic</a> several years ago). Darren covered the scientific background of this <i>lunisolar</i> calendar, and the changes that have taken place to it historically over the ~3500 years it has been around &#8211; particularly interesting to me, since I&#8217;m a historian by background. It&#8217;s a complicated system which takes account of 19 year lunar cycles, requires things like leap months, and has a set of rules which specify how it works&#8230; but it is certainly more comprehensible once you understand those aspects. It was interesting to realise just how much my own perceptions of time are based on the calendar system I&#8217;ve grown up with!</p>
