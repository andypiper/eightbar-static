<p>This week I had a day out of the office to go to Zurich to talk at this years IBM developerWorks Days. I had 2 sessions back to back in the mobile stream, the first an introduction to Android Development and the second on MQTT.</p>
<p>The slots were only 35mins long (well 45mins, but we had to leave 5 mins on each end to let people move round) so there was a limit to how much detail I could go into. With this in mind I decided the best way to give people a introduction to Android Development in that amount of time was to quickly walk through writing reasonably simple application. The application had to be at least somewhat practical, but also very simple so after a little bit of thinking about I settled on an app to download the latest image from the web comic <a href="http://xkcd.org/">XKCD</a>. There are a number apps on Google Play that already do this (and a lot better) but it does show a little Activity GUI design. I got through about 95% of the app live on stage and only had to copy &#038; paste the details for the onPostExecute method to clear the progress dialog and update the image in the last minute to get it to the point I could run it in the emulator.</p>
<p>Here are the slides for this session</p>

<p>And here is the Eclipse project for the Application I created live on stage:<br />
<a href="http://www.hardill.me.uk/XKCD-demo-android-app.zip">http://www.hardill.me.uk/XKCD-demo-android-app.zip</a></p>
<p>The MQTT pitch was a little easier to set up, there is loads of great content on <a href="http://mqtt.org/">MQTT.org</a> to use as a source and of course I remembered to include the section on the MQTT enabled mouse traps and twittering ferries from <a href="http://twitter.com/andysc">Andy Stanford-Clark</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the slides for the MQTT session:</p>

<p>For the Demo I used the Javascript d3 topic tree viewer I <a href="http://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/?p=1111" title="d3 MQTT topic tree visualiser">blogged about</a> last week and my Raspberry Pi running a <a href="http://mosquitto.org/">Mosquitto</a> broker and a little script to publish the core temperature, load and uptime values. The broker was also bridged to my home broker to show the feed from my weather centre and some other sensors.</p>

<p>A project at work recently came up to do with using one of the <a href="http://emotiv.com/">Emotiv</a> headsets to help out a former Italian IBMer who was suffering from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locked-in_syndrome">locked in syndrome</a>. The project was being led by <a href="http://kevinxbrown.blogspot.com/">Kevin Brown</a> who was looking for ways to use the headset to drive things sending email and browsing the web but he was also looking for a way to interact with some other tech around the house. The TV was the first on the list.</p>
<p>Continuing on from my previous work with <a href="http://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/?p=25">controlling TVs</a> and <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/2011/09/16/mqtt-powered-video-wall/">video walls</a> with <a href="http://mqtt.org/">MQTT</a> I said I would have a crack at this. My earlier solution was limited to LG TVs with serial ports and this needed to work with any make so a different approach was needed. It also needed to run on Windows so it was also a chance to play with C# and .Net.</p>
<p>To be TV agnostic it was decided to use a USB IR remote from a company called <a href="http://www.redrat.co.uk/index.html">RedRat</a>. They make a number of solutions, but their RedRat III was perfect for what was needed.</p>
<p><a class="alignleft" title="RedRat IR transmitter &amp; receiver by hardillb, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardillb/7136002505/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7066/7136002505_cbfced5a8a_n.jpg" alt="RedRat IR transmitter &amp; receiver" width="240" height="320" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.redrat.co.uk/software/SDK/index.html">RedRat API</a> comes with bindings for C++, .Net on Windows (and a <a href="http://www.lirc.org/">LIRC</a> plugin for Linux). The RedRat III is not just a IR transmitter, it is also a receiver which means it can &#8220;learn&#8221; from existing remote controls so it can be used with any TV.</p>
<p>Kevin is using Emotiv headset to drive <a href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/">Dasher</a> as the input device. Dasher is a sort of keyboard replacement that allows the user to build up words using at a minimum a single input e.g. a single push button. As well as building words other actions can be added to the selector, Kevin added actions for browsing and also to control the TV. These actions publish MQTT messages to a topic with payloads like &#8220;volUp&#8221;, &#8220;chanDown&#8221; or &#8220;power&#8221;.</p>
<p>So now we had the inputs it was time to get round to writing the code to turn those messages into IR signals. There are 2 MQTT .NET libraries listed on the MQTT.org software page. I grabbed the first off the list <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mqttdotnet/">MqttDotNet</a> and got things working pretty quickly.</p>
<p>The following few lines sets up a connection and subscribes to a topic.</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp; gutter: true">String connectionString = &quot;tcp://&quot; + 
  Properties.Settings.Default.host.Trim() + &quot;:&quot; +
  Properties.Settings.Default.port;
IMqtt client = MqttClientFactory.CreateClient(connectionString, &quot;mqtt2ir&quot;);
try
{
	client.Connect(true);
	client.PublishArrived += new PublishArrivedDelegate(onMessage);
	client.ConnectionLost += new ConnectionDelegate(connectionLost);
	client.Subscribe(Properties.Settings.Default.topic.Trim(), 
	  QoS.BestEfforts);
}</pre>
<p>Where the onMessage callback looks like this:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp; gutter: true">bool onMessage(object sender, PublishArrivedArgs msg)
{
	String command = msg.Payload.ToString().Trim();
	IRPacket packet = loadSignal(command);
	if (packet != null) 
	{
		redrat.OutputModulatedSignal(packet);
	}
	return true;
}</pre>
<p><a href="http://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/MQTT2IR.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-986" title="MQTT2IR Settings Window" src="http://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/MQTT2IR.png" alt="MQTT2IR Settings Window" width="300" height="249" /></a></p>
<p>And that is pretty much the meat of the whole application, the rest was just some code to initialise the RedRat and to turn it into a System Tray application with a window for entering the broker details and training the commands.</p>
<p>Unfortunately just a few days before we were due to have delivered this project we learned that the intended recipient had picked up a respiratory infection and had passed away. I would like to extend my thoughts to their family and I hope we can find somebody who may find this work useful in the future.</p>
