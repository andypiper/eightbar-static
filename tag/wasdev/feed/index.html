<h2>What is Monki Gras?</h2>
<p>Well&#8230;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>So, how to explain <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a>? Like TED but smaller, more random and with <a href="https://twitter.com/monkchips">@monkchips</a> in charge</p>

<p>And Ricardo makes a good point, explaining why I, and others, just keep going back:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>Back home from <a href="https://twitter.com/monkigras">@monkigras</a>.  <a href="https://twitter.com/redmonk">@redmonk</a> has me completely spoiled as to what a conference is supposed to be like.</p>
<p>&mdash; Ricardo J. Méndez (@ArgesRic) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArgesRic/status/561647182278066177">January 31, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a single track of talks so you are saved the effort of making decisions about what to see and you can just focus on listening. The speakers entertain as well as inform, which, I really like.</p>
<p>While it is a tech conference, there&#8217;s little code because it&#8217;s about making technology happen rather than the details of the technology itself. So there are talks on developer culture, design, and data, as well as slightly more off-the-wall things to keep our brains oiled.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/monkchips" title="James Governor on Twitter">James&#8217;</a> very own distinctive words:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>turns out if you ask people to be creative and not just give the normal pitch they do a fucking great job. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/protip?src=hash">#protip</a> for conference organisers</p>
<p>&mdash; Mönki Gras (@monkigras) <a href="https://twitter.com/monkigras/status/560812330234425344">January 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>What a great crowd, all celebrating <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/nordiccraft?src=hash">#nordiccraft</a>! <a href="http://t.co/2wmsrrzv52">pic.twitter.com/2wmsrrzv52</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Mönki Gras (@monkigras) <a href="https://twitter.com/monkigras/status/560854249492729858">January 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<h2>Why go all Nordic this year?</h2>
<p>All the speakers this year were Scandinavian in some way. It was probably the most rigorously applied conference theme I&#8217;ve ever seen (mostly, conferences come up with a &#8216;theme&#8217; for marketing purposes which usually gets mostly forgotten about by the time of the conference itself).</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>What have the Nordics done for us? &lt;- Basically the theme for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a> this year. Turns out, quite a lot. ☺</p>
<p>&mdash; Laura Cowen (@lauracowen) <a href="https://twitter.com/lauracowen/status/560815323419803648">January 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>James talks a bit more about this on the <a href="http://monkigras.com/blog/" title="Scandinavian focus on the Monkigras blog">Monkigras blog</a>. A surprising amount of tech we know and love comes out of the relatively sparsely populated Scandinavian countries. For example:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/monkchips">@monkchips</a> Yes please. Don&#39;t forget, Finland builds our internet <img src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> &lt;3 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ssh?src=hash">#ssh</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/irc?src=hash">#irc</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/git?src=hash">#git</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Linux?src=hash">#Linux</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MySQL?src=hash">#MySQL</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/opensource?src=hash">#opensource</a> cc <a href="https://twitter.com/GabbiCahane">@gabbicahane</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/monkigras">@monkigras</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Pia Henrietta K (@PHenriettaK) <a href="https://twitter.com/PHenriettaK/status/552135512203726848">January 5, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>And, apparently, Finland leads the EU in enterprise cloud computing:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Cloud computing used by 1 in 5 enterprises in the EU in 2014, 1 in 2 in Finland <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Eurostat?src=hash">#Eurostat</a> <a href="http://t.co/CuMAzNIPoD">http://t.co/CuMAzNIPoD</a> <a href="http://t.co/JGMwAJ1v5Y">pic.twitter.com/JGMwAJ1v5Y</a></p>
<p>&mdash; European Commission (@EU_Commission) <a href="https://twitter.com/EU_Commission/status/542260605542203392">December 9, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Are the Nordics really that different from anywhere else?</h2>
<p>Well, this graph seems to say they are, if only for their taste in music:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>Metal bands per 100.000 inhabitants <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a> <a href="http://t.co/eTZf2MJl59">pic.twitter.com/eTZf2MJl59</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Lars Trieloff (@trieloff) <a href="https://twitter.com/trieloff/status/560854416564449280">January 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Which suggests there is at least <em>something</em> different about Nordic cultures from the rest of Europe, let alone the world.</p>
<p>So several of the speakers delved into why they thought this led to success in technology innovation and development. For example, there&#8217;s the attitude to not recognising when you&#8217;re failing and giving up so that you can be successful by doing it another way:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>There is no shame in turning around and giving up. And give up as soon as possible then you don&#39;t die. &#8211; Norwegian Mountain Code. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Laura Cowen (@lauracowen) <a href="https://twitter.com/lauracowen/status/560766645925605376">January 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>A Swedish concept, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagom" title="Lagom on Wikipedia">lagom</a></em>, which means &#8216;just the right amount&#8217; was credited with the popularity of the cloud in the Nordics. And, indeed, with pretty much anything we could think of throughout the rest of the event.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>The cloud is more popular in the Nordics, because it allows you to spend just the right amount (lagom) on infrastructure <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Lars Trieloff (@trieloff) <a href="https://twitter.com/trieloff/status/560783321144492035">January 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Similarly, you could argue that lagom is why Docker is popular among developers:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>Why is <a href="https://twitter.com/docker">@docker</a> so hot? It allows developers to get back to craftsmanship, not to worry about things they don&#39;t care about <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Danese Cooper (@DivaDanese) <a href="https://twitter.com/DivaDanese/status/561151492774973440">January 30, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p>One fascinating talk, by a Swedish speaker based in Silicon Valley, was about the difference between startups in the Nordics and Silicon Valley. For example, the inescapable differences between their welfare systems were credited as being responsible for different priorities regarding making money. (Hopefully, videos of the talks will be put online and I&#8217;ll add a link to it.)</p>
<p>Obviously, all this talk about culture can, and did, drift into stereotyping. I did get slightly weary of the repeated comparisons between cultures, though interesting and, often, humorous.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Anyone who uses stereotypes is a terrible person. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Simon Phipps (@webmink) <a href="https://twitter.com/webmink/status/561124125708914690">January 30, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Developer culture</h2>
<p>One of the things I&#8217;m most interested in is hearing what other companies have learnt about developer culture and community. For example:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>Spotify has scaled to over 1,200 people by getting developers to work in small autonomous &quot;Squads&quot; <a href="http://t.co/5yFvMBQcvn">http://t.co/5yFvMBQcvn</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Sam Shead (@Sam_L_Shead) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sam_L_Shead/status/562255415812292609">February 2, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>There&#8217;s more about this talk on <a href="http://www.techworld.com/startups/spotify-developer-squads-key-swedish-startups-success-3596415/" title="Spotify's developer squads on Techworld">Techworld</a>. And Spotify have blogged some funky videos about the developer culture they aspire to (<a href="https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/" title="Spotify engineering culture: part 1">part 1</a> and <a href="https://labs.spotify.com/2014/09/20/spotify-engineering-culture-part-2/" title="Spotify engineering culture: part 2">part 2</a>), which are well worth watching if you work in software development.</p>
<p>Something that I&#8217;m working on at IBM is increasing the openness of our development teams so, again, I&#8217;m always interested in new ways to do this. This is something that Sweden (yes, the country!) has adopted to a surprising extent:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Swedish citizens take turns at curating the official <a href="https://twitter.com/sweden">@sweden</a> Twitter account! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Laura Cowen (@lauracowen) <a href="https://twitter.com/lauracowen/status/560746078585507840">January 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Innovation and inefficiencies</h2>
<p>One important message that came across at Monki Gras 2015 was that you have to allow time for innovation to happen. It&#8217;s when things seem inefficient and time is not allocated to a specific activity that innovation often occurs.</p>
<p>A nice example of this is the BrewPi project. At Monki Gras 2013, Elco Jacobs talked about his open source project of brewing beer and using a Raspberry Pi to monitor it:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OeVKxg8NP_I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I bumped into him this year and what had been a project now occupies him full-time as a small business selling the technology to brewers around the world. A pause in his education when he had nothing better to do had enabled him to get on with his BrewPi project and, after graduation, turn it into a business.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Fun conversations about <a href="https://twitter.com/brew_pi">@brew_pi</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a> <a href="http://t.co/sXYGvJ6ck5">http://t.co/sXYGvJ6ck5</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Paul Johnston (@PaulDJohnston) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulDJohnston/status/561169434501713920">January 30, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>It&#39;s really important that Finland has really inefficient universities because people start tinkering and solving problems <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Paul Johnston (@PaulDJohnston) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulDJohnston/status/560817347767050240">January 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Data journalism</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot talked about <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2014/apr/15/big-data-open-data-transform-government" title="Big data vs open data in The Guardian">open data</a> and how we should be able to access tax-funded data about things that affect our lives. The Guardian is taking a lead with <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/data-journalism" title="Data journalism at The Guardian">data journalism</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/HelenaBengtsson">Helena Bengtsson</a> gave a talk about how knowing how to navigate large data sets to find meaning was vital to finding stories in the Wikileaks data.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Inspiring talk on “Data Journalism” from <a href="https://twitter.com/HelenaBengtsson">@HelenaBengtsson</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a>. Talking through how learning simple SQL helped use <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks">@wikileaks</a> data.</p>
<p>&mdash; Daniel Appelquist (@torgo) <a href="https://twitter.com/torgo/status/560830299106340864">January 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>She started out in data journalism in Sweden where, in one case, she acquired and mapped large data sets that revealed water pollution problems around the country, which triggered a several stories.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just having the data that matters but the interpretation of the data. That&#8217;s what data journalism gives us over just &#8216;big data':</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/beauvais">@beauvais</a>: Sure. We see the same with our analysis. When we hand people data, they largely don&#39;t care, without the interpretation.</p>
<p>&mdash; Donnie Berkholz (@dberkholz) <a href="https://twitter.com/dberkholz/status/560830919011885056">January 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Also, I found out a fascinating fact:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Scandinavia: gov info is public unless classified otherwise. Rest of Europe: gov info is confidential unless they say otherwise. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Laura Cowen (@lauracowen) <a href="https://twitter.com/lauracowen/status/560833203158929409">January 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s about as much as I can cram in. We also found out random things about Scandinavian knitwear and the fact that Sweden has its own official typeface, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/14/sweden-sans-designers-create-national-font" title="Sweden Sans in The Guardian">Sweden Sans</a>. And we ate lots of Nordic foods, drank Nordic beer and (some of us) drank Akvavit. And, most importantly, we talked to each other lots.</p>
<p>The thing I really value about Monki Gras (on top of the great talks, food, drink, and fun atmosphere) is the small size of the event and all the interesting people to talk to. That&#8217;s why I keep going back.</p>
<p>P.S. <a href="http://tangentialthoughts.com/it-trends/monkigras-becomes-nordigras/" title="Monki Gras 2015 write-up">A good write-up of the talks</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="http://monkigras.com/">Monkigras</a> 2013, I was really looking forward to Monkigras 2014. The great talks about developer culture and creating usable software, the amazing buzz and friendliness of the event, the wonderful lack of choice over which talks to go to (there&#8217;s just one track!!), and (of course) the catering:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1988" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/coffee-300x230.jpg" alt="coffee" width="300" height="230" /><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1987" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/cheese-300x247.jpg" alt="cheese" width="300" height="247" /></p>
<h2>The talks at Monkigras 2014</h2>
<p>The talks were pretty much all great so I&#8217;m just going to mention the talks that were particularly relevant to me.</p>
<p><a title="@rafeco" href="http://twitter.com/rafeco">Rafe Colburn</a> from <a href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> talked about how to motivate developers to fix bugs (IBMers, read &#8216;defects&#8217;) when there&#8217;s a big backlog of bugs to fix. They&#8217;d tried many strategies, including bug rotation, but none worked. The answer, they found, was to ask their support team to help prioritise the bugs based on the problems that users actually cared about. That way, the developers fixing the bugs weren&#8217;t overwhelmed by the sheer numbers to choose from. Also, when they&#8217;d done a fix, the developers could feel that they&#8217;d made a difference to the user experience of the software.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1991" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1991 size-medium" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/rafe-300x223.jpg" alt="rafe" width="300" height="223" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Rafe Colburn from Etsy</figcaption></figure>
<p>While I&#8217;m not responsible for motivating developers to fix bugs, my job does involve persuading developers to write articles or sample code for <a href="https://www.ibmdw.net/wasdev/">WASdev.net</a>. So I figure I could learn a few tricks.</p>
<p>A couple of talks that were directly applicable to me were <a title="@TheSteve0" href="http://twitter.com/TheSteve0">Steve Pousty</a>&#8216;s talk on how to be a developer evangelist and <a title="@geekygirldawn" href="http://twitter.com/geekygirldawn">Dawn Foster</a>&#8216;s on taking lessons on community from science fiction. The latter was a quick look through various science fiction themes and novels applied to developer communities, which was a neat idea though I wished I&#8217;d read more of the novels she cited. I was particularly interested in Steve&#8217;s talk because I&#8217;d seen him speak last year about how his PhD in Ecology had helped him understand communities as ecosystems in which there are sometimes surprising dependencies. This year, he ran through a checklist of attributes to look for when hiring a developer evangelist. Although I&#8217;m not strictly a developer evangelist, there&#8217;s enough overlap with my role to make me pay attention and check myself against each one.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1989" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1989 size-medium" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dawn-300x288.jpg" alt="dawn" width="300" height="288" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Dawn Foster from Puppet Labs</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the risks of TED Talk-style talks is that if you don&#8217;t quite match up to the &#8216;right answers&#8217; espoused by the speakers, you could come away from the event feeling inadequate. The friendly atmosphere of Monkigras, and the fact that some speakers directly contradicted each other, meant that this was unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>It was still refreshing, however, to listen to <a title="@postwait" href="http://twitter.com/postwait">Theo Schlossnagle</a> basically telling people to do what they find works in their context. Companies are different and different things work for different companies. Similarly, developers are people and people learn in different ways so developers learn in different ways. He focused on how to tell stories about your own failures to help people learn and to save them from having to make the same mistakes.</p>
<p>Again, this was refreshing to hear because speakers often tell you how you should do something and how it worked for them. They skim over the things that went wrong and end up convincing you that if only you immediately start doing things their way, you&#8217;ll have instant success. Or that inadequacy just kicks in like when you read certain people&#8217;s Facebook statuses. Theo&#8217;s point was that it&#8217;s far more useful from a learning perspective to hear about the things that went wrong for them. Not in a morbid, defeatist way (that way lies only self-pity and fear) but as a story in which things go wrong but are righted by the end. I liked that.</p>

<p><a title="@" href="http://twitter.com/ananelson">Ana Nelson</a> (geek conference buddy and friend) also talked about storytelling. Her point was more about telling the right story well so that people believe it rather than believing lies, which are often much more intuitive and fun to believe. She impressively wove together an argument built on various fields of research including Psychology, Philosophy, and Statistics. In a nutshell, the kind of simplistic headlines newspapers often publish are much more intuitive and attractive because they fit in with our existing beliefs more easily than the usually more complicated story behind the headlines.</p>

<p>The Gentle Author spoke just before lunch about his daily blog in which he documents stories from local people. I was lucky enough to win one of his signed books, which is beautiful and engrossing. Here it is with my swagbag:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="474"><p>My swag bag from <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monkigras?src=hash">#monkigras</a> &#8211; I was a lucky recipient of a beautiful, signed London Album by <a href="https://twitter.com/thegentleauthor">@thegentleauthor</a> <a href="http://t.co/6BaqBdtXP5">pic.twitter.com/6BaqBdtXP5</a></p>

<p>After his popular talk last year, <a title="@philgilbertsr" href="http://twitter.com/philgilbertsr">Phil Gilbert</a> of IBM returned to give an update on how things are going with Design@IBM. Theo&#8217;s point about context of a company being important is so relevant when trying to change the culture of such a large company. He introduced a new card game that you can use to help teach people what it&#8217;s like to be a designer working within the constraints of a real software project. I heard a fair amount of interest from non-IBMers who were keen for a copy of the cards to be made available outside IBM.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1993" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1993 size-medium" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wildducksgame-300x193.jpg" alt="wildducksgame" width="300" height="193" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Phil Gilbert’s Wild Ducks card game</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the UX theme, I loved <a title="@leisa" href="http://twitter.com/leisa">Leisa Reichelt</a>&#8216;s talk about introducing user research to the development teams at GDS. While all areas of UX can struggle to get taken seriously, user research (eg interviewing participants and usability testing) is often overlooked because it doesn&#8217;t produce visual designs or code. Leisa&#8217;s talk was wonderfully practical in how she related her experiences at GDS of proving the worth of user research to the extent that the number of user researchers has greatly increased.</p>
<p>And lastly I must mention <a href="http://projectandiamo.com/">Project Andiamo</a>, which was born at Monkigras 2013 after watching a talk about <a title="Monkigras 2013: Scaling craft" href="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/2013/02/10/monkigras-2013-scaling-craft/">laser scanning and 3D printing old railway trains</a>. The project aims to produce medical orthotics, like splints and braces, by laser scanning the patient&#8217;s body and then 3D printing the part. This not only makes the whole process much quicker and more comfortable, it is at a fraction of the cost of the way that orthotics are currently made.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1990" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1990 size-medium" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/projectandiamo-300x182.jpg" alt="projectandiamo" width="300" height="182" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Samiya Parvez &amp; Naveed Parvez of Project Andiamo</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you can help in any way, take a look at their website and get in touch with them. Samiya and Naveed&#8217;s talk was an amazing example of how a well-constructed story can get a powerful message across to its listeners:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="http://monkigras.com/">Monkigras</a> 2013, I was really looking forward to Monkigras 2014. The great talks about developer culture and creating usable software, the amazing buzz and friendliness of the event, the wonderful lack of choice over which talks to go to (there&#8217;s just one track!!), and (of course) the catering:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1988" src="http://i1.wp.com/lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/coffee.jpg?resize=300%2C230" alt="coffee" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/coffee.jpg?resize=300%2C230 300w, http://i1.wp.com/lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/coffee.jpg?w=600 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1987" src="http://i0.wp.com/lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/cheese.jpg?resize=300%2C247" alt="cheese" srcset="http://i0.wp.com/lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/cheese.jpg?resize=300%2C247 300w, http://i0.wp.com/lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/cheese.jpg?w=600 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h2>The talks at Monkigras 2014</h2>
<p>The talks were pretty much all great so I&#8217;m just going to mention the talks that were particularly relevant to me.</p>
<p><a title="@rafeco" href="http://twitter.com/rafeco">Rafe Colburn</a> from <a href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> talked about how to motivate developers to fix bugs (IBMers, read &#8216;defects&#8217;) when there&#8217;s a big backlog of bugs to fix. They&#8217;d tried many strategies, including bug rotation, but none worked. The answer, they found, was to ask their support team to help prioritise the bugs based on the problems that users actually cared about. That way, the developers fixing the bugs weren&#8217;t overwhelmed by the sheer numbers to choose from. Also, when they&#8217;d done a fix, the developers could feel that they&#8217;d made a difference to the user experience of the software.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1991" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1991 size-medium" src="http://i2.wp.com/lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/rafe.jpg?resize=300%2C223" alt="rafe" srcset="http://i2.wp.com/lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/rafe.jpg?resize=300%2C223 300w, http://i2.wp.com/lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/rafe.jpg?w=600 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Rafe Colburn from Etsy</figcaption></figure>
<p>While I&#8217;m not responsible for motivating developers to fix bugs, my job does involve persuading developers to write articles or sample code for <a href="https://www.ibmdw.net/wasdev/">WASdev.net</a>. So I figure I could learn a few tricks.</p>
<p>A couple of talks that were directly applicable to me were <a title="@TheSteve0" href="http://twitter.com/TheSteve0">Steve Pousty</a>&#8216;s talk on how to be a developer evangelist and <a title="@geekygirldawn" href="http://twitter.com/geekygirldawn">Dawn Foster</a>&#8216;s on taking lessons on community from science fiction. The latter was a quick look through various science fiction themes and novels applied to developer communities, which was a neat idea though I wished I&#8217;d read more of the novels she cited. I was particularly interested in Steve&#8217;s talk because I&#8217;d seen him speak last year about how his PhD in Ecology had helped him understand communities as ecosystems in which there are sometimes surprising dependencies. This year, he ran through a checklist of attributes to look for when hiring a developer evangelist. Although I&#8217;m not strictly a developer evangelist, there&#8217;s enough overlap with my role to make me pay attention and check myself against each one.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1989" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1989 size-medium" src="http://i0.wp.com/lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dawn.jpg?resize=300%2C288" alt="dawn" srcset="http://i0.wp.com/lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dawn.jpg?resize=300%2C288 300w, http://i0.wp.com/lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dawn.jpg?w=600 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Dawn Foster from Puppet Labs</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the risks of TED Talk-style talks is that if you don&#8217;t quite match up to the &#8216;right answers&#8217; espoused by the speakers, you could come away from the event feeling inadequate. The friendly atmosphere of Monkigras, and the fact that some speakers directly contradicted each other, meant that this was unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>It was still refreshing, however, to listen to <a title="@postwait" href="http://twitter.com/postwait">Theo Schlossnagle</a> basically telling people to do what they find works in their context. Companies are different and different things work for different companies. Similarly, developers are people and people learn in different ways so developers learn in different ways. He focused on how to tell stories about your own failures to help people learn and to save them from having to make the same mistakes.</p>
<p>Again, this was refreshing to hear because speakers often tell you how you should do something and how it worked for them. They skim over the things that went wrong and end up convincing you that if only you immediately start doing things their way, you&#8217;ll have instant success. Or that inadequacy just kicks in like when you read certain people&#8217;s Facebook statuses. Theo&#8217;s point was that it&#8217;s far more useful from a learning perspective to hear about the things that went wrong for them. Not in a morbid, defeatist way (that way lies only self-pity and fear) but as a story in which things go wrong but are righted by the end. I liked that.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1992" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://twitter.com/ananelson"><img class="wp-image-1992 size-medium" src="http://i2.wp.com/lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/theo.jpg?resize=300%2C236" alt="theo" srcset="http://i2.wp.com/lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/theo.jpg?resize=300%2C236 300w, http://i2.wp.com/lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/theo.jpg?w=600 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Theo Schlossnagle from Circonus</figcaption></figure>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I attended <a href="http://redmonk.com/thingmonk/">ThingMonk 2013</a> conference partly because <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/info/internet-of-things/">IBM&#8217;s doing a load of work around the Internet of Things</a> (IoT). I figured it would be useful to find out what&#8217;s happening in the world of IoT at the moment. Also, I knew that, as a *Monk production, the food would be amazing.</span></p>
<h2><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">What is the Internet of Things?</span></h2>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">If you&#8217;re reading this, you&#8217;re familiar with using devices to access information, communicate, buy things, and so on over the Internet. The Internet of Things, at a superficial level, is just taking the humans out of the process. So, for example, if your washing machine were connected to the Internet, it could automatically book a service engineer if it detects a fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I say &#8216;at a superficial level&#8217; because there are obviously still issues relevant to humans in an automated process. It matters that the automatically-scheduled appointment is convenient for the householder. And it matters that the householder trusts that the machine really is faulty when it says it is and that it&#8217;s not the manufacturer just calling out a service engineer to make money.</span></p>
<p>This is how <a href="https://twitter.com/monkchips">James Governor</a> of <a href="http://redmonk.com/">RedMonk</a>, who conceived and hosted ThingMonk 2013, explains IoT:</p>

<h2>What is ThingMonk 2013?</h2>
<p>ThingMonk 2013 was a fun two-day conference in London. On Monday was a hackday with spontaneous lightning talks and on Tuesday were the scheduled talks and the evening party. I wasn&#8217;t able to attend Monday&#8217;s hackday so you&#8217;ll have to read someone else&#8217;s write-up about that (you could try <a href="http://josiemessa.wordpress.com/2013/12/09/thingmonk-day-1/">Josie Messa&#8217;s</a>, for instance).</p>
<h2>The talks</h2>
<p>I bought my Arduino getting started kit (which I used for <a title="Electricity monitoring with Christmas lights and Arduino" href="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/2010/02/09/electricity-monitoring-with-christmas-lights-and-arduino/">my Christmas lights energy project</a> in 2010) from Tinker London so I was pleased to finally meet Tinker&#8217;s former-CEO, <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://twitter.com/iotwatch">Alexandra Dechamps-Sonsino</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">, at ThingMonk 2013. I&#8217;ve known her on Twitter for about 4 years but we&#8217;d never met in person. Alex is also founder of the <a href="https://twitter.com/GNLteam">Good Night Lamp</a>, which <a title="The Ambient Kettle" href="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/2013/03/16/the-ambient-kettle/">I blogged about earlier this year</a>. She talked at ThingMonk about &#8220;the past, present and future of the Internet of Things&#8221; from her position of being part of it.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_2004" style="width: 163px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2004" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_1557-163x300.jpg" alt="Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino, @iotwatch" width="163" height="300" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino, @iotwatch</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I think it was probably </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://twitter.com/knolleary">Nick O&#8217;Leary</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> who first introduced me to the Arduino, many moons ago over cups of tea at work. He spoke at ThingMonk about </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://knolleary.net/2013/12/05/wiring-the-internet-of-things-thingmonk-talk/">wiring the Internet of Things</a>. This included a demo of <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">his latest project, </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://nodered.org/">NodeRED</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">, which he and IBM have recently </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://github.com/node-red/node-red">open sourced on GitHub</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_2005" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2005" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_1570-300x206.jpg" alt="Nick O'Leary talks about wiring the Internet of Things" width="300" height="206" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Nick O&#8217;Leary talks about wiring the Internet of Things</figcaption></figure>
<p>Sadly I missed the previous day when it seems Nick and colleagues, <a href="https://twitter.com/ceejay">Dave C-J</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/andysc">Andy S-C</a>, won over many of the hackday attendees to the view that IBM&#8217;s <a href="http://mqtt.org/">MQTT</a> and NodeRED are the coolest things known to developerkind right now. So many people mentioned one or both of them throughout the day. One developer told me he didn&#8217;t know why he&#8217;d not tried MQTT 4 years ago. He also seemed interested in playing with NodeRED, just as soon as the shock that IBM produces cool things for developers had worn off.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/ianskerrett">Ian Skerrett</a> from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> talked about the role of Open Source in the Internet of Things. Eclipse has recently started the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/paho/">Paho</a> project, which focuses on open source implementations of the standards and protocols used in IoT. The project includes IBM&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/groups/service/html/communityview?communityUuid=d5bedadd-e46f-4c97-af89-22d65ffee070">Really Small Message Broker</a> and Roger Light&#8217;s <a href="http://mosquitto.org/">Mosquitto</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1998" style="width: 277px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1998" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_1596-277x300.jpg" alt="Ian Skerrett from Eclipse" width="277" height="300" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ian Skerrett from Eclipse</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/andypiper">Andy Piper</a> talked about <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/andypiper/the-internet-of-things-is-made-of-signals">the role of signals in the IoT</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2002" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_1546-300x210.jpg" alt="IMG_1546" width="300" height="210" /></p>
<p>There were a couple of talks about people&#8217;s experiences of startups producing physical objects compared with producing software. <a href="http://twitter.com/tomtaylor">Tom Taylor</a> talked about setting up <a href="http://www.newspaperclub.com/">Newspaper Club</a>, which is a site where you can put together and get printed your own newspaper run. His presentation included this slide:</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/genmon"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2000" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_1534-300x191.jpg" alt="IMG_1534" width="300" height="191" />Matt Webb</a> talked about producing <a href="http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/">Little Printer</a>, which is an internet-connected device that subscribes to various sources and prints them for you on a strip of paper like a shop receipt.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/goodmachine"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2003" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_1550-300x195.jpg" alt="IMG_1550" width="300" height="195" />Patrick Bergel</a> made the very good point in his talk that a lot of IoT projects, at the moment, are aimed at &#8216;non-problems&#8217;. While fun and useful for learning what we can do with IoT technologies, they don&#8217;t really address the needs of real people (ie people who aren&#8217;t &#8220;hackers, hipsters, or weirdos&#8221;). For instance, there are increasing numbers of older people who could benefit from things that address problems social isolation, dementia, blindness, and physical and cognitive impairments. His point was underscored throughout the day by examples of fun-but-not-entirely-useful-as-is projects, such as flying a drone with fruit. That&#8217;s not to say such projects are a waste of time in themselves but that we should get moving on projects that address real problems too.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2001" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_1539-300x226.jpg" alt="IMG_1539" width="300" height="226" />The talk which chimed the most with me, though, was <a href="http://twitter.com/clurr">Claire Rowland</a>&#8216;s on the important user experience UX issues around IoT. She spoke about the importance of understanding how users (householders) make sense of automated things in their homes.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1996" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_1587-249x300.jpg" alt="IMG_1587" width="249" height="300" /></p>
<h2>The book</h2>
<p>I bought a copy of <a href="https://twitter.com/amcewen">Adrian McEwan</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://book.roomofthings.com/">Designing The Internet of Things</a> book from Alex&#8217;s pop-up shop, <a href="https://twitter.com/Works_Shop">(Works)shop</a>. Adrian&#8217;s a regular at <a href="http://oggcamp.org/">OggCamp</a> and kindly agreed to sign my copy of his book for me.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1999" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1999" src="http://lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_1599-300x255.jpg" alt="Adrian McEwan and the glamorous life of literary reknown." width="300" height="255" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Adrian McEwan and the glamorous life of literary reknown.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>The food</h2>
<p>The food was, as expected, amazing. I&#8217;ve never had bacon and scrambled egg butties that melt in the mouth before. The steak and Guinness casserole for lunch was beyond words. The evening party was sustained with sushi and tasty curry.</p>
<p>Thanks, James!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">The work of <a title="William Morris in Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morris" >William Morris</a>, my <a title="GCSE on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education" >GCSE</a> history teacher said, was a bit of a moral dilemma. Morris was a British designer born during the <a title="The Industrial Revolution on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" >Industrial Revolution</a>. British (and then world) industry was moving rapidly towards mass production by replacing traditional, cottage-industry production processes with the more efficient, and therefore profitable, machines. One thing that suffered under this move to mass production was the focus on function and quantity over decoration and quality. Morris reacted against this by designing and producing decorations like wallpaper and textiles using the traditional craft techniques of skilled craftspeople. My history teacher&#8217;s point was that although Morris, a passionate socialist, was able to create high quality goods by using smaller-scale production methods, only wealthy people could afford to buy his designs; which was hardly equality in action. On the other hand, the skills of craftspeople were being retained, quality goods were being produced, and the craftspeople were getting paid for that quality of their work.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1527" style="width: 179px;" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1527 " src="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-01-31-13.05.19-179x300.jpg" alt="My pretty, handcrafted latte" width="179" height="300" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">My pretty, handcrafted latte</figcaption></figure>
<p><a title="Monkigras website" href="http://monkigras.com/" >Monkigras 2013</a>, in London last week, took on this theme of &#8216;scaling craft&#8217; in the context of beer, coffee, and software. All parts of this trinity of software development can benefit hugely from a focus on quality over quantity. Before I went to Monkigras, I wasn&#8217;t really sure what to expect from a tech event advertised as having a lot of beer. It did have a lot of beer (and coffee) available but if you didn&#8217;t want it you could avoid it (several people I talked to said they didn&#8217;t usually drink beer). And no one seemed to get ridiculously drunk. And there were a lot of very cool talks.</p>
<p>The beer was also a fun analogy to apply to software development. Despite <a title="Closed pubs project website" href="http://www.closedpubs.co.uk/" >pubs in the UK closing hand over fist</a> at the moment, microbreweries are on the rise. <a title="Microbreweries on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbrewing" >Microbrewing</a> is about producing beer in small quantities on a commercial basis so that quality can be maintained whilst still viable as a business. One of the things we learnt from a brewer at Monkigras is that the taste of water varies according to where it comes from. Water is a major component of beer so if the taste of your water supply changes, the taste of your beer changes. To maintain the quality of the beer you brew, you must work within the natural resources available to you and not over-expand. Similarly, quality comes from skilled and knowledgeable people who need to be paid for their skill. If you take on cheaper staff and train them less so that you can make more profit, you will end up with a poorer quality product. You get the idea.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1526" style="width: 179px;" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1526 " src="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-01-15.32.42-179x300.jpg" alt="Handcrafting a wooden spoon." width="179" height="300" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Handcrafting a wooden spoon.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This principle applies to all areas of craft, whether it&#8217;s producing quality coffee, a quality wooden spoon, quality conference food, or organising a quality conference, you have to focus on quality and ensure that if you scale what you do so that it&#8217;s more readily available to more people, you don&#8217;t sacrifice quality at the same time. And, importantly, that you know when to stop. Bigger doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean better.</p>
<p>Software is misleadingly easy to produce. Unlike making physical objects, there is very little initial cost to producing software; you can make copies and then distribute them to customers over the Internet at very little cost. Initially, at least, it&#8217;s all in the skill of the craftspeople and their ability to identify their target users and market. If they can&#8217;t make what people will buy, they will go out of business very quickly. As software development companies get larger, the people who make the software inside the company become further removed from the selling of their software to their customers. So they become more focused on what they are close to, the technology but not who will use it.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1535" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1535 " src="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_1074-300x196.jpg" alt="Phil Gilbert on IBM Design Thinking" width="300" height="196" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Phil Gilbert on IBM Design Thinking</figcaption></figure>
<p><a title="Phil Gilbert on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/philgilbertsr" >Phil Gilbert</a>, IBM&#8217;s new General Manager of Design, comes from a 30-year career in startups, most recently <a title="Lombardi acquisition press release" href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/28890.wss" >Lombardi</a>, where design was core to their culture. IBM has a portfolio of 3000 software products so, when Lombardi was acquired by IBM, Phil set about simplifying the <a title="IBM BPM product page" href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/business-process-manager/" >IBM Business Process Management</a> portfolio of products, reducing 21 different products to just four and kicking off a cultural change to bring design and thinking about users to the centre of product development. Whilst praising IBM&#8217;s history of design and a recent server product design award, he also acknowledged at Monkigras: &#8220;We are rethinking everything at IBM. Our portfolio is a mess today and we need to get better&#8221;. Changing a culture like IBM&#8217;s isn&#8217;t easy but I&#8217;ve seen and experienced a big difference already. Phil&#8217;s challenge is to scale the high-quality user-focused design values of a startup to a <a title="IBM100 website" href="http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/" >century-old</a> global corporation.</p>
<p>One of the things that struck me most at Monkigras, and appealed to me most as a social scientist, was the focus on the human side. Despite it being a developer conference, I remember seeing only one slide that contained code. The overriding theme was about people and culture, not technology; how to maintain quality by maintaining a culture that respects its craftspeople and how to retain both even if the organisation gets bigger, even if that naturally limits how much the organisation can grow. Personal analogy was also a big thing&#8230;</p>
<figure id="attachment_1536" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1536 " src="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_1076-cropped-300x218.jpg" alt="Laser-scanned model of the engine" width="300" height="218" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Laser-scanned model of the engine</figcaption></figure>
<p><a title="Cyndi on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/mitchellcyndi" >Cyndi Mitchell</a> from Logspace talked about her family&#8217;s hog farm and working within the available resources. <a title="Shanley on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/shanley" >Shanley Kane</a> from Basho used Dante&#8217;s spheres to describe best product management practices. <a title="Steve on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/TheSteve0" >Steve Citron-Pousty</a> from RedHat use his background as an ecologist to manage communities and &#8216;developer ecosystems&#8217; (don&#8217;t just call it an ecosystem; treat it like one). <a title="Diane on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/pythondj" >Diane Mueller</a> from ActiveState talked about her 20%-time project to build a crowdsourced database of totem poles and the challenges of understanding what gets people to want to contribute to such projects. <a title="Elco on Twitter" href="http://www.elcojacobs.com/" >Elco Jacobs</a> talked about his BrewPi project: automatically managing the temperature of his homebrewing fridge using a RaspberryPi based controller, and how he has open-sourced to build a community to kick start it as a potential small business. <a title="Rafe on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/rafeco" >Rafe Colburn</a> from Etsy more directly makes the link between craft and software engineering in <a title="Rafe's slides" href="https://speakerdeck.com/rafeco/artisinal-software-manufacturing" >his slides</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1532" style="width: 179px;" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1532 " src="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-01-15.35.52-179x300.jpg" alt="3D printer making a spoon" width="179" height="300" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">3D printer making a spoon</figcaption></figure>
<p>I don&#8217;t know much about William Morris so I don&#8217;t know which presentations he would have enjoyed or disagreed with. Morris was a preservationist and started the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings to ensure that old buildings get repaired and not restored to an arbitrary point in the past. So maybe he would have found laser-scanning and <a title="3D printing on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3d_printing" >3D printing</a> interesting. <a title="Chris on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/jaggeree" >Chris Thorpe</a> is a model train geek and likes to hand-make his own models of real-life objects. He too is interested in alternatives to mass manufacturing and has started to look at how to make model kits. He uses a laser to scan the objects and a 3D printer to prototype the models. He can then send the model to a commercial company who can make it into kits for him to sell. He has recently used his laser-scanning technique to scan a rediscovered old Welsh railway engine to preserve it, virtually at least, in the state in which it was found.</p>
<p>I had a great time with lots of cool and fun people. Well done to <a title="@monkchips on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/monkchips" >@monkchips</a> for scaling a conference to just the right level of intimacy and buzz. The last thing I saw before I left was the craftsman making a wooden spoon pitted in competition against the 3D printer making a plastic spoon.</p>
<p>You can find many of the slide presentations and more about the conference <a title="Monkigras on Lanyrd" href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/monkigras/" >Lanyrd</a>.</p>
