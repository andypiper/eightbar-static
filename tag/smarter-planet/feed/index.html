				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As <a href="http://twitter.com/eightbar/status/9977537541">we tweeted the other day</a>, we have some great stuff coming up in the next few weeks. We&#8217;ll start with a guest post from <a href="http://twitter.com/anghelides">Peter Anghelides</a></p>
<p style="border-top-width: thin; border-top-style: dotted; border-top-color: #FFFFFF;">
<p>There&#8217;s a snappy new website about <a href="http://www.ibmideaslab.co.uk/">IBM&#8217;s Ideas Lab in the UK</a>. It talks about the kind of people who work here, and has links to a virtual tour of the site, a Smarter Planet video, <a href="http://ibmideaslab.blogspot.com/">blogs</a> by recent graduates <a href="http://ibmideaslab.blogspot.com/2010/02/hey-im-ed-i-joined-ibm-in-september.html">Ed</a> and <a href="http://ibmideaslab.blogspot.com/2010/02/introducing-clare-software-developer-at.html">Clare</a>, a simulation game, and some pictures of shoes.</p>
<p><a href="http://ibmideaslab.co.uk"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990" title="ideaslab" src="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ideaslab.jpg" alt="The Ideas Lab" width="485" height="105" srcset="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ideaslab.jpg 485w, http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ideaslab-300x64.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" /></a></p>
<div id="_mcePaste">Welcome to the IBM Ideas Lab &#8211; the recruitment marketing team have been working on a bit of a rebrand of the UK Software Labs in reaching out to students and graduates.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">Check out the microsite <a href="http://www.ibmideaslab.co.uk/">here</a>. Â Students and grads can find out about what it is like to work at the labs and some of the cool things that people work on here. Â We want to shout about all the fantastic stuff that comes out of the &#8216;Ideas Lab&#8217; and attract males and females from all degree backgrounds into these roles.</div>
<p>So where are all those brilliant biologists, fantastic philosophers, genius geographers, clever chemists, marvellous mathematicians&#8230;? You&#8217;ll have to come up with your own descriptions for English, History, Psychology&#8230; but they should apply, too.</p>
<p style="border-top-width: thin; border-top-style: dotted; border-top-color: #FFFFFF;">
<p>[oi! I&#8217;m an historian thanks very much Peter! &#8230; hmm&#8230; enlightened English graduates? psuper psychologists? hintelligent historians&#8230;? &#8211; <a href="http://twitter.com/andypiper">Andy</a> &#8230; and if you want to read more about what life is like at Hursley, there was a lovely piece <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/technology/article7052560.ece">in the Sunday Times &#8220;Inside the IBM Dream Factory&#8221;</a> a couple of weekends back]</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m over in the US at the moment, and I was out of the office all of last week as well, but I see that the BBC has been visiting my friends and colleagues at the Hursley mothership.</p>
<p>The coverage is in two parts. Firstly there&#8217;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8035425.stm">a nice article on the BBC News website</a> which talks about the history of Hursley, some of the software developed at the lab such as CICS and MQTT, and (of course) Andy Stanford-Clark&#8217;s twittering house.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a set of interviews with IBMers such as <a href="http://twitter.com/kevinxbrown">Kevin Brown</a> talking about the twittering Hursley minibus, in the May 5th episode of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/digitalp">Digital Planet</a> podcast (here&#8217;s <a href="http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/worldservice/digitalp/digitalp_20090505-1030a.mp3">a direct link to the MP3</a>). The IBM coverage starts from around about 17 minutes in to the programme.</p>
<p>So, if you were wondering what wild and wacky things we get up to at Hursley &#8211; we do a lot of different stuff, and it can be very cool indeed <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week I&#8217;ve been at IBM&#8217;s IMPACT 2009 conference in Las Vegas, along with a lot of my colleagues from IBM Hursley. As I <a href="http://andypiper.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/impact-work-play-product-announcements/">wrote over on my personal blog</a>, this is an event aimed at Smart SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) and the Smarter Planet&#8230; but the synergies between them are bringing in all kinds of interesting themes and topics from the emerging technology space, including virtual worlds and gaming, social computing, and green / sustainable computing.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/2008/10/15/handheldlearning-2008-virtual-worlds-for-educators/">briefly mentioned INNOV8</a> on eightbar before. It&#8217;s a serious game for business and education aimed at teaching the principles of Business Process Management. The latest version was announced at IMPACT this week. <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/solutions/soa/innov8/index.html">INNOV8 2.0</a> is playable on the web, and has a set of new scenarios covering Smarter Supply Chain, Smarter Traffic, and Smarter Customer Service. The trailer is great &#8211; very movie-like <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><object width="480" height="295"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Vb1Thz-u_kQ&#038;ap=%2526fmt%3D18&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1&#038;rel=0&#038;color1=0x3a3a3a&#038;color2=0x999999"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Vb1Thz-u_kQ&#038;ap=%2526fmt%3D18&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1&#038;rel=0&#038;color1=0x3a3a3a&#038;color2=0x999999" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="295"></embed></object></p>
<p>If you want a sneak peek at the gameplay, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NitK8GgW1lU&#038;fmt=18">check this video</a> too.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[One of the first Hursley-related things I wrote about here on the eightbar blog back in 2006 was how much I enjoy helping with our annual schools event for National Science and Engineering Week in the UK &#8211; Blue Fusion &#8230; <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/2009/03/10/blue-fusion-at-hursley-2009/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the first Hursley-related things I wrote about here on the <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/2006/03/15/the-genetics-of-dragons-and-the-wisdom-of-monkeys/">eightbar blog</a> back in 2006 was how much I enjoy helping with our annual schools event for National Science and Engineering Week in the UK &#8211; Blue Fusion (the event website has gone AWOL at the moment but <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/uk/en/pressrelease/26865.wss">here&#8217;s a link to the press release</a>).</p>
<p>This year was no exception. This is now the fifth year that I&#8217;ve been a volunteer. Unfortunately I only had room in my schedule to spend one day helping this time around, so I choose to host a school for the day rather than spending all day on a single activity (that way, I got to see all of the different things we had on offer). </p>
<p>So, yesterday I had the pleasure of hosting six intelligent and polite students from <a href="http://www.malvernstjames.co.uk/pages/default.aspx">Malvern St James School</a> and their teachers &#8211; they had travelled a fair distance to come to the event, but despite the early start I think they did really well.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t go into too much detail and spoil the fun for people who might read this but have not yet taken part in this week&#8217;s event, but I think we had some great activities on offer. I <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=&amp;ands=&amp;phrase=&amp;ors=&amp;nots=&amp;tag=&amp;lang=all&amp;from=andypiper&amp;to=&amp;ref=&amp;near=&amp;within=15&amp;units=mi&amp;since=2009-03-09&amp;until=2009-03-09&amp;source=&amp;rpp=50">twittered our way</a> through a few of them. My own personal favourite was a remote surgery activity. You can&#8217;t see much in this image (it was a dark room) but the students basically had a &#8220;body&#8221; inside a box with some remote cameras to guide their hands around and had to identify organs and remove foreign objects. </p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://andypiper.wordpress.com/files/2009/03/img_3774.jpg"><img src="http://andypiper.wordpress.com/files/2009/03/img_3774.jpg?w=300" alt="img_3774" title="img_3774" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1184" /></a></div>
<p>There was also some interesting application of visual technology / tangible interfaces &#8211; a genetics exercise using LEGO bricks and a camera which identified gene strands, and an energy planning exercise which used Reactivision-style markers to identify where power stations had been placed on a map (sort of similar to what we built in <a href="http://andypiper.wordpress.com/2007/06/17/slorpedo/">SLorpedo at Hackday</a> a couple of years ago). We also had some logic puzzles to solve, built a, err&#8230; &#8220;typhoon-proof&#8221; (ahem) tower, simulated a computer processor, and commanded a colony of ants in a battle for survival against the other school teams.</p>
<p>Once again, I thought this was a great event &#8211; just amazing creativity on show from the folks at Hursley in coming up with such engaging exercises. I hope the students had as much fun as I did!</p>
