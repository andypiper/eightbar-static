<p>This week I went up to Newcastle for <a href="http://www.thinkingdigital.co.uk/">Thinking Digital</a>. </p>
<p>It was the seventh Thinking Digital, but my first. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d seen a bunch of references to it being <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=thinking+digital+uk+ted">the UK&#8217;s answer to TED</a>, the tickets aren&#8217;t cheap, <a href="http://vimeo.com/thinkingdigital">videos from previous years</a> look slick and professional, it&#8217;s held in <a href="http://www.sagegateshead.com/">The Sage</a> which is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+sage+gateshead&#038;tbm=isch">a hugely impressive venue</a>, they manage to get a great line-up of speakers, and the logistics in the run-up to the event were more organised than any event I&#8217;ve been to before. </p>
<p>So&#8230; I was expecting a cool and geeky, if faceless, serious, formal, and intimidating event.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d read it completely wrong. It&#8217;s absolutely a professionally run event. And there was no shortage of cool geekiness. But, more than that, the organizer, Herb Kim, has created a real sense of community in it. There&#8217;s a feeling of almost familial warmth amongst attendees who come year after year after year.</p>
<p>And they do it without being too cliquey. Everyone I spoke to was very friendly and welcoming, which made the few days a lot easier for an introvert like me. A few days being surrounded by and trying to talk to and socialise with several hundred smart brilliant people is the kind of thing I normally find hugely draining and more than a little daunting. But the crowd at TDC make it easier than most. </p>
<p>They value their time there, too. More than one person told me they&#8217;d paid for their own ticket and expenses to attend. I&#8217;m used to corporate-run conferences where everyone is paid for by their employer, or barcamps where people moan about being asked for a five pound deposit, so this surprised me. </p>
<p>The talks made for a fascinating and thought-provoking couple of days. I can&#8217;t do them justice here (<em>when videos of the talks are available I&#8217;ll embed/link them here instead</em>) but I want to give an idea of what <a href="http://www.thinkingdigital.co.uk/schedule/">the programme</a> was like.</p>

And I did a Watson talk. I really didn&#8217;t want it to seem like a sales pitch, so I tried to put it in a bigger context of being a step forwards in changing how we use computers. I talked about why I work on Watson, what motivates and inspires me about it, and why I think what we&#8217;re doing is difficult but hopefully valuable. And I walked through a short demo to explain the value I see in where we are even now. Annoying technical issues (<em>Keynote + clicker + multiple screens = fail</em>) aside, it went okay. It was a lot to try and fit into 20 minutes, so I talked fast. <img src="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p><strong>Overall&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>It was a fantastic event, and one I&#8217;d wholeheartedly recommend. </p>
<p>If you can get to a future Thinking Digital, you absolutely should. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s one of the most thought-provoking and interesting couple of days I&#8217;ve had in a long time. </p>
<p>.</p>
