				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This time of year seems to be hacking season and over the last few days I&#8217;ve been along to two <a href="http://subdigit.com/blog/hackday-explained/">hackdays</a>!</p>
<p>Friday was <a href="http://www.brianodonovan.ie/2012/08/hacking-becomes-mainstream-in-ibm.html">IBM&#8217;s internal Social Business Hackday</a>. There was some MQTT hacking, a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/MartinPacker/entry/hackday_x_batch_analytics_baby_steps42">z/OS hack</a>, hacks with Lotus Connections, hacks that could be the future of Lotus Connections, and I was attempting to hack a work around for a <a href="https://jazz.net/jazz/web/projects/Jazz%20Foundation#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&amp;id=216492">Jazz work item</a>. And that was just at the Hursley local event! We were able to link up with a few other labs, but over two days there were IBMers hacking around the globe. There are going to be a lot of amazing projects to choose from when it comes to voting.</p>

<p>(There are a few more photos from HackDay X, and previous hackdays, on the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/hackday_ibm/">IBM hackday group on flickr</a>.)</p>
<p>For round two, today was the <a href="http://southackton.org.uk/2012/09/19/hack-day/">soutHACKton hack day</a>. By the time I arrived the soldering and drilling had already begun!! Unfortunately I wasn&#8217;t able to stay long so I&#8217;m hoping there&#8217;ll me more of these in the future. I did just about have time to try out an idea I had to hack an old doorbell to sense people using the door knocker. A while ago I had accidentally created a touch sensor with a 555 timer while <a href="http://jtlog.wordpress.com/2009/06/22/my-first-currentcost-development-board-circuit/">attempting to build another circuit</a>. So my cunning plan was to deliberately create a <a href="http://fritzing.org/projects/digital-input-555-touch-switch/">555 touch switch</a> and connect it to the bolt on the inside of the front door. Unfortunately the best I could manage today was a two wire touch sensor, which isn&#8217;t going to work. At least not without leaving a wire hanging out of the letter box with some instructions attached! Unless someone who knows more about electronics can suggest a plan B, I may just resort to a boring doorbell button instead!!</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/jtlog.wordpress.com/2085/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/jtlog.wordpress.com/2085/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=jtlog.wordpress.com&#038;blog=1751515&%23038;post=2085&%23038;subd=jtlog&%23038;ref=&%23038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
