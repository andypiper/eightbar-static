				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ten years ago. </p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_2003">6 August 2003</a>. </p>
<p>I was a recent University graduate, arriving at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hursley_House">IBM&#8217;s R&#038;D site in Hursley</a> for the first time. I remember arriving in Reception.</p>

<small><em><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dalelane/9301212174/">Reception &#8211; the view that greeted me when I arrived</a></em></small></p>
<p>Ten years. </p>
<p>It was a Wednesday. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m still at the same company. I&#8217;m still at the same site. I still do the same drive to work, more or less.  </p>
<p>For a *decade*. </p>
<p>How did that happen? </p>
<p>It was never The Plan. The Plan (as cynical as it sounds in hindsight) was that I&#8217;d stay for two or three years. I figured that would be long enough to get experience, and then I&#8217;d leave to work at a small nimble start-up which was where all the &#8220;cool&#8221; work was. </p>
<p>The Plan never happened. A few years passed, and then another few&#8230; I kept saying that I&#8217;d leave &#8220;later&#8221; and before I knew it a ten year milestone has kind of snuck up on me. </p>
<p>I think I&#8217;m more surprised than anyone. I&#8217;ve never been at any place this long. I was <a href="http://cv.dalelane.co.uk/education">at Uni for five years</a>. The longest I was at any school was four years. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a serious commitment, and one I never realised that I had made. I&#8217;ve not even been married for as long as I&#8217;ve been with IBM. </p>
<p>So why? Why am I still here?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dalelane/9301204058/" title="I live here. by dalelane, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3726/9301204058_b60aebfb55_m.jpg" width="223" height="148" style="border: thin black solid; border-right: none;"  alt="I live here."/></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dalelane/9301212502/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7456/9301212502_a99bf100d3_m.jpg" width="223" height="148" style="border: thin black solid"/></a></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1.2em">It&#8217;s been varied</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent ten years working for the same company, but I&#8217;ve had <a href="http://cv.dalelane.co.uk/employment">several jobs in this time</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a software developer. I&#8217;ve been a test engineer. I&#8217;ve been a service engineer, fixing problems with customer systems. I&#8217;ve worked as a consultant, advising clients about technology through presentations and running workshops. I&#8217;ve done services work building prototypes and first-of-a-kind pilot systems for clients. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written code to run on tiny in-car embedded systems and apps that ran on mobile phones. I&#8217;ve worked as a System z Mainframe developer. I&#8217;ve written front-end UI code, and I&#8217;ve written heavy-duty server jobs that took hours to run (<em>even when they weren&#8217;t supposed to</em>). </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dalelane/9301209740/"><img style="border: thin black solid" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3774/9301209740_33acfb9aa6.jpg" width="448" height="298"/></a><br />
<small><em><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dalelane/9301209740/">IBM Hursley</a></em></small></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1.2em">It&#8217;s still challenging</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked on middleware technology, getting some of the biggest computer systems in the world to communicate with each other, reliably, securely and at scale. I&#8217;ve used analytics to get insight from massive amounts of data. I&#8217;ve worked on large-scale fingerprint and voiceprint systems. I&#8217;ve used natural language processing to build systems that attempt to interpret unstructured text. I&#8217;ve used machine learning to create systems that can be trained to perform work. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m still learning new stuff and still regularly have to figure out how to do stuff that I have no idea how to at the start. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dalelane/9301207474/" ><img style="border: thin black solid; border-right: none;" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7393/9301207474_d5d6cdb18a_m.jpg" width="223" height="148"/></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dalelane/9298423727/" ><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5455/9298423727_c47281af2e_m.jpg" width="223" height="148" style="border: thin black solid"/></a><br />
<small><em><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dalelane/9301207474/">Some views of the grounds around the office</a></em></small></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1.2em">I get to do more than just a &#8220;day job&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>I do random stuff outside the day job. I&#8217;ve helped organise week long schools events to <a href="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=133">teach kids about science and technology</a>. I&#8217;ve <a href="http://cv.dalelane.co.uk/index.php/employment/extreme-blue/">mentored teams of University students</a> on summer-long residential innovation projects. I&#8217;ve prepared and delivered training courses to school kids, school teachers and charity leaders. I&#8217;ve <a href="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=2597">written an academic paper</a> and presented it at a peer-reviewed research conference. And lots more.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a developer, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;ve spent ten years churning out code 40 hours a week. There&#8217;s always something new and different.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dalelane/9301208824/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7317/9301208824_c62ff62d00.jpg" width="448" height="298" style="border: thin black solid" /></a><br />
<small><em><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dalelane/9301208824/">Hursley House &#8211; where I normally work when I have customers visiting</a></em></small></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1.2em">I work on stuff that matters</strong></p>
<p>Tim O&#8217;Reilly has been talking for years about the importance of working on stuff that matters. </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Work on something that matters to you more than money&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;ve not heard any of his talks around this, I&#8217;d recommend having a look. There are lots of examples of <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/timoreilly/etech-09-keynote-work-on-stuff-that-matters">his slides</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ycuu7KaDURM">talks</a>, <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/01/work-on-stuff-that-matters-fir.html">blog posts</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hc7Z5gmwXOg">interviews</a> around. </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t do his message justice here, but I just want to say that he describes a big part of how I feel very well. I want to work on stuff that I can be proud of. Not just technically proud of, although that&#8217;s important too. But the pride of doing something that will make a difference.</p>
<p>Working for a massive company gives me chances to do that. I&#8217;ve worked on projects for governments, and police forces, and Universities. I&#8217;ve done work that I can be proud of. </p>
<p>For the last couple of years, I&#8217;ve been working on <a href="http://ibmwatson.com/">Watson</a>. It&#8217;s a very cool collection of technologies, and watching the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qosrP1AiMWA">demo of it competing on a US game show</a> has a geeky thrill that doesn&#8217;t get old. But that&#8217;s not the most exciting bit. Watson could be a turning point. This could change how we do computing. If you look at what we&#8217;re trying to do with Watson in medicine, we&#8217;re trying to transform how we deliver healthcare. This stuff matters. It&#8217;s exciting to be a part of.  </p>

<small><em><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dalelane/9301209294/">These are the views that surround the site</a></em></small></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1.2em">I like the lifestyle</strong></p>
<p>Hursley is a campus-style site. It&#8217;s miles from the nearest town, and surrounded by fields and farms. It&#8217;s quiet and has loads of green open space. </p>
<p>My commute is a ten minute drive through a village and fields. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have to wear a suit, and I don&#8217;t stand out coming to work in a hoodie and combat trousers. Flexitime has been the norm for most of my ten years, and I am free to plan a work day that suits me. When I need to be out of the office by 3pm to get the kids from school, I can.  </p>
<p>My kids are at a school half-way between home and the office, so I can do the school run on the way to work. As the school is only five minutes from work, I often nip out to see them do something in an assembly, or have lunch with them. </p>
<p>This is a nice aspect of the school &#8211; that parents are welcome to join their kids for lunch, and have a school dinner with them and their friends in the school canteen. But still&#8230; it&#8217;s pretty cool, and if I didn&#8217;t work just up the road from them, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to do it. </p>
<p>Once a month, I bring them to work in the morning before school starts for <a href="https://twitter.com/dalelane/status/332769636061958144">a cooked breakfast in the Clubhouse</a> with the rest of my team.  </p>
<p>All of this and a lot more tiny aspects like it add up to a lifestyle that I like. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dalelane/9301198874/" title="More train tickets by dalelane, on Flickr"><img style="border: thin black solid" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3735/9301198874_8e21edae05.jpg" width="448" height="298" alt="More train tickets"/></a><br />
<small><em><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dalelane/9301198874/">Some of my train tickets from the last few years</a></em></small></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1.2em">I get to see the world</strong></p>
<p>I enjoy travelling. I love seeing new places. </p>
<p>But I&#8217;d hate a job where I lived out of a suitcase and never saw the kids. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve managed to find a nice balance. I travel, but usually on short trips and not too often.</p>
<p>In 2006, I worked at IBM&#8217;s La Gaude site near Nice. In 2007, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines and Paris. In 2008, I worked in Copenhagen, Paris and Hamburg. In 2009, I worked in Munich many times, and Rotterdam. In 2010, Stockholm. In 2011, Tel Aviv and Haifa in Israel, Austin in Texas, Paris and Berlin. Last year, I worked in Zurich and Littleton, Massachusetts. </p>
<p>This year, I&#8217;ve been in <a href="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=2608">Rio de Janeiro</a> and <a href="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=2806">Littleton again</a>, and it looks like I&#8217;ll be in Lisbon in December.</p>
<p>Plus working around the UK. It&#8217;s less glamorous, but it&#8217;s still interesting to go to new places. I&#8217;ve worked in loads of places, like Edinburgh, York, Swansea, Malvern, Warwick, Portsmouth, Cheshire, Northampton, Guildford&#8230; I occasionally have to work in London, although <a href="https://twitter.com/dalelane/status/355346134258028544">I tend to moan about it</a>. And I spent a few months working in Farnborough. I think I moaned about that, too. <img src="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>Travelling is a great opportunity. I couldn&#8217;t afford to have been to all the places that IBM has sent me if I had to pay for it myself. </p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 1.2em">The pay is amazing!</strong></p>
<p>Hahahahaha&#8230; no. </p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 1.2em">Will I be here for another ten years?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to explain why I&#8217;m happy and enjoying what I do. I&#8217;m not saying I couldn&#8217;t get exactly the same or better somewhere else. Because I don&#8217;t know. Other than a year I spent as <a href="http://cv.dalelane.co.uk/index.php/employment/motorola/">an intern at Motorola</a> I&#8217;ve never worked anywhere else. For all I know, the grass might be greener somewhere. </p>
<p>Will I still be here in another ten years? I dunno&#8230; I do worry if that&#8217;s unambitious. I wonder if I should try somewhere else. I wonder if only ever working for one company is giving me an institutionalised and insular view of the world. </p>
<p>I keep getting emails from LinkedIn about all the people I know who have new jobs. There are a bunch of people I used to work with at IBM who have not only left to work at other companies, but have since left those companies and gone on to something even newer. While I&#8217;m still here. </p>
<p>Am I destined to be one of those IBMers who works at Hursley forever? That&#8217;s a scary thought. </p>
<p>For now, I&#8217;m enjoying what I do, so that&#8217;s good enough for me. </p>
<p>Happy 10th anniversary to me.</p>
