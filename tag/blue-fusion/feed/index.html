				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the first Hursley-related things I wrote about here on the <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/2006/03/15/the-genetics-of-dragons-and-the-wisdom-of-monkeys/">eightbar blog</a> back in 2006 was how much I enjoy helping with our annual schools event for National Science and Engineering Week in the UK &#8211; Blue Fusion (the event website has gone AWOL at the moment but <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/uk/en/pressrelease/26865.wss">here&#8217;s a link to the press release</a>).</p>
<p>This year was no exception. This is now the fifth year that I&#8217;ve been a volunteer. Unfortunately I only had room in my schedule to spend one day helping this time around, so I choose to host a school for the day rather than spending all day on a single activity (that way, I got to see all of the different things we had on offer). </p>
<p>So, yesterday I had the pleasure of hosting six intelligent and polite students from <a href="http://www.malvernstjames.co.uk/pages/default.aspx">Malvern St James School</a> and their teachers &#8211; they had travelled a fair distance to come to the event, but despite the early start I think they did really well.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t go into too much detail and spoil the fun for people who might read this but have not yet taken part in this week&#8217;s event, but I think we had some great activities on offer. I <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=&amp;ands=&amp;phrase=&amp;ors=&amp;nots=&amp;tag=&amp;lang=all&amp;from=andypiper&amp;to=&amp;ref=&amp;near=&amp;within=15&amp;units=mi&amp;since=2009-03-09&amp;until=2009-03-09&amp;source=&amp;rpp=50">twittered our way</a> through a few of them. My own personal favourite was a remote surgery activity. You can&#8217;t see much in this image (it was a dark room) but the students basically had a &#8220;body&#8221; inside a box with some remote cameras to guide their hands around and had to identify organs and remove foreign objects. </p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://andypiper.wordpress.com/files/2009/03/img_3774.jpg"><img src="http://andypiper.wordpress.com/files/2009/03/img_3774.jpg?w=300" alt="img_3774" title="img_3774" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1184" /></a></div>
<p>There was also some interesting application of visual technology / tangible interfaces &#8211; a genetics exercise using LEGO bricks and a camera which identified gene strands, and an energy planning exercise which used Reactivision-style markers to identify where power stations had been placed on a map (sort of similar to what we built in <a href="http://andypiper.wordpress.com/2007/06/17/slorpedo/">SLorpedo at Hackday</a> a couple of years ago). We also had some logic puzzles to solve, built a, err&#8230; &#8220;typhoon-proof&#8221; (ahem) tower, simulated a computer processor, and commanded a colony of ants in a battle for survival against the other school teams.</p>
<p>Once again, I thought this was a great event &#8211; just amazing creativity on show from the folks at Hursley in coming up with such engaging exercises. I hope the students had as much fun as I did!</p>
