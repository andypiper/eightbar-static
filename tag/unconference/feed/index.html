				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If I don&#8217;t post a few notes from today&#8217;s <a href="http://odcamp.org.uk/">Open Data Camp</a> now, I never will, so here are a few things I scribbled down- it could be worse, I could have posted a PDF containing photos of the the actual scribbles!</p>
<p>So <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ag75qK9Aqm79dGNsbDBHVlJKUnFCbjZNb0V4TVZQc3c&amp;usp=sharing#gid=11">out of this choice</a>&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="https://jtlog.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/odcamp-sessions.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2462" src="https://jtlog.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/odcamp-sessions.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="odcamp-sessions" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230;I picked, Open Data for Elections, Open Addresses, Data Literacy, Designing Laws using Open Data, and Augmented Reality for Walkers.</p>
<h1>Open Data for Elections</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ve been following @<a href="https://twitter.com/floppy">floppy</a>&#8216;s crazy plan to get elected for a while, so this was the easiest decision of the day: what drives someone to embrace the gory inner workings of democracy like this?</p>
<p>Falling turnout it would seem, and concern for a functioning democracy.</p>
<p>The first step of his journey was the <a href="http://openpolitics.org.uk/">Open Politics Manifesto</a>, which I&#8217;ve so far failed to edit- must try harder.</p>
<p>Perhaps more interesting was how this, and use of open data, fits into a political platform as a service. It would be nice to have the opportunity to see a few additions to the usual suspects at the ballot box, and Eastleigh got a rare chance to see what that could be like with a by election. Perhaps open data services for candidates could tip he balance enough to encourage more people to stand.</p>
<p>Things that sounded interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://democracyclub.org.uk/">Democracy Club</a></li>
<li><a href="https://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a></li>
<li><a href="http://data.okfn.org/doc/data-package">Data Packages</a></li>
<li>Open data certificates (food hygiene certificates for data?)</li>
<li>Candidates get one free leaflet delivery by Royal Mail- I wonder how big they expect those leaflets to be!</li>
</ul>
<h1>Open Addresses</h1>
<p>@<a href="http://twitter.com/floppy">floppy</a> and @<a href="https://twitter.com/giacecco">giacecco</a> introduced the (huge) problems they need to overcome to rebuild a large data set without polluting that data with any sources with intellectual property restrictions. <a href="https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/">Open Addresses</a> still have a long way to go and there were comments about how long Open Street Map has been around, and it still has gaps.</p>
<p>They have some fun ideas about crowd sourcing address data (high vis jacket required) and there are some interesting philosophical questions around consent for addresses to be added.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see whether Open Addresses can get enough data to provide real value, and what services they build.</p>
<h1>Data Literacy</h1>
<p>Mark and Laura led a discussion around data literacy founded in the observation that competent people, with all the skills you could reasonably expect them to have, still struggle with handling data sets.</p>
<p>Who needs to be data literate? Data scientists? Data professionals? Everyone?</p>
<p>Data plumbers? There were some analogies with actual plumbers! You might not be a plumber but it&#8217;s useful to know something about it.</p>
<p>If we live in a data driven society, we should know how to ask the right questions. Need domain expertise and technical expertise.</p>
<p>Things that sounded interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Data Cookbook</li>
<li><a href="http://opendatahandbook.org/">Open Data Handbook</a></li>
</ul>
<h1>Designing Laws using Open Data</h1>
<p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/johnlsheridan">johnlsheridan</a> pointed out that the least interesting thing to do with legislation is to publish it and went on to share some fascinating insights into the building blocks of statute law. It sounds like the slippery language used in legislation boils down to a small number of design patterns built with simple building blocks, such as a duty along with a claim right, and so on.</p>
<p>Knowing these building blocks makes it easier to get the gist of what laws are trying to achieve, helps navigate statutes, and could give policy makers a more reliable way to effect a goal.</p>
<p>For example, it&#8217;s easier to make sense of the legislation covering supply of gas, and it&#8217;s possible to identify where there may be problems. The gas regulator has a <em>duty</em> to protect the interests of consumers by promoting competition, but that&#8217;s a weak duty without a clear <em>claim right</em> to enforce it.</p>
<p>John also demonstrated a tool &#8211; <a href="http://ngrams.elasticbeanstalk.com/">http://ngrams.elasticbeanstalk.com</a> &#8211; exploring how the language used in legislation has changed over time, for example how the use of &#8220;shall&#8221; has declined and been replaced by &#8220;is to be&#8221;.</p>
<h1>Augmented Reality for Walkers</h1>
<p>My choice of Android tablet was largely based on what might work reasonably well for maps and augmented reality, so I seized this opportunity!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/nickw">Nick Whitelegg</a> described the Hikar Android app he&#8217;s been working on, which is intended to help hikers follow paths by overlaying map data on a live camera feed.</p>
<p>The data is a combination of Open Street Map mapping data, with Ordnance Survey height data, which is downloaded and cached as tiles around your current location. Open GL is used to overlay a 3D view of the map data on the live camera feed, using the Android sensor APIs to detect the device&#8217;s rotation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just downloaded and installed <a href="http://www.free-map.org.uk/downloads/android/hikar-latest.apk">Hikar</a> and, while my tablet is a tad slow, it works really well. I live somewhere flat and boring but the height data made a noticeable difference when Nick demonstrated the app in hilly Winchester.</p>

I live somewhere flat and boring but the height data made a noticeable difference when Nick demonstrated the app in hilly Winchester.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two weekends ago, I, with the rest of the <a title="Ubuntu UK podcast website" href="http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org" target="_blank">Ubuntu-UK Podcast</a> team and the <a title="Linux Outlaws website" href="http://linuxoutlaws.com" target="_blank">Linux Outlaws</a> podcast team, was in Wolverhampton to run a new one-day open source community unconference called <a title="OggCamp website" href="http://oggcamp.org" target="_blank">OggCamp</a>.</p>
<p>A few people have asked &#8220;why Wolverhampton?&#8221;. Which is a fair question considering that four of the organisers live in Hampshire, one in the South-West, one in Liverpool, and one in Bonn.</p>
<p>Well, Wolverhampton is the location of the annual <a title="LugRadio LIve 2009 website" href="http://lugradio.org/live/2009/" target="_blank">LugRadio Live</a> open source community conference. The organisers of LugRadio Live (the LugRadio podcast presenters) are, or were, based in Wolverhampton. While there are many things you could say about Wolverhampton, one thing that always impressed me was that, to attend LugRadio Live, people flew to Wolverhampton from all over the UK, from all over Europe, all over the States, and even from Hong Kong and Australia at times (see <a title="LugRadio Put To Bed blog post#" href="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/blog/2008/07/14/lugradio-put-to-bed/" target="_blank">my blog post about past LRLs</a> for more).</p>
<p>Last year, after four hugely popular LugRadio Live events, including one in San Francisco sponsored by Google, the team announced that the fortnightly LugRadio podcast was going to end, and so the fifth LugRadio Live (in July 2008) would be the last ever LugRadio Live.</p>
<p>And then, under pressure from Popular Demand, they agreed to do another last ever LugRadio Live &#8211; in October 2009. This last ever LugRadio Live, though, would only be one day, the Saturday, like their first ever LugRadio Live. Which left a whole Sunday to fill. Which is where OggCamp comes in.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-967" src="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/23102009213-001.jpg" alt="The Connaught Hotel Welcomes OggCamp" width="173" height="230" srcset="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/23102009213-001.jpg 600w, http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/23102009213-001-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 173px) 100vw, 173px" />When we decided to organise OggCamp, we had no idea how it would go down. We figured that, between the two podcasts (Ubuntu-UK Podcast and Linux Outlaws) we&#8217;d had enough positive feedback that we could get at least 50 people along. Because it would be the day after LRL, there was a chance that enough LRL attendees would stick around for the day on Sunday and coming to OggCamp too. To make extra sure of that, we decided to hold OggCamp in the official LRL hotel (so that the geeks could just roll out of bed and into OggCamp), and to make the event free to attend.</p>
<p>In the end, about 130 people came to OggCamp. Which was brilliant!</p>
<p>The sight of people queuing up three flights of stairs to come in at 10.30 on the Sunday morning left us briefly gob-smacked.</p>
<p>We kicked off at about 11am with a quick introduction from all the presenters in which we explained how there was no pre-arranged schedule and that to sign up for a talk you just had to write it on a sticky note (large notes for full-hour talks; half-sized notes for half-hour talks) and stick it in a slot in the grid on the wall.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauracowen/4086762587/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2789/4086762587_6407fbd058.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="233" /></a></p>
<p>First up was <a title="AndySC on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/andysc" target="_blank">Andy Stanford-Clark</a> who did a brand new talk, specially written for OggCamp (and completed the night before while the rest of us were at the LRL kareoke party), about the geekier details of his Twittering House (the stuff the BBC didn&#8217;t get!). By midday, the schedule was getting pretty full (something of a relief!) and the planned topics included web services, how to prove identity on the Net, how to encourage young people to use Open Source Software, politics and geeks (from <a title="Open Rights Group website" href="http://openrightsgroup.org" target="_blank">ORG</a>), translating Playstation 2 games, and how to explain programming to non-programmers!</p>
<p>At 3pm, everyone gathered in the main room to watch a live joint recording of the Ubuntu-UK Podcast and Linux Outlaws. This started with a live raffle draw (surely a first in open source events?) for some very cool prizes donated by <a title="Our lovely OggCamp 2009 sponsors" href="http://oggcamp.org/2009/start#sponsors" target="_blank">our sponsors</a>, including a couple of Viglen MPC-Ls, some Ubuntu laptop bags and hoodies, an O&#8217;Reilly book, and an Arduino Mega. After the raffle, we did two segments: one about producing media using Open Source Software, and one about whether or not the Open Source community spreads itself too thin by creating so many different distributions. The segments included a lot of audience interaction, and also real-time twittering from the audience on to the TwitterFall screen behind us on-stage.</p>
<p>The live show was something that we had been nervous about because six is a large number of people to be talking anyway but also because the two podcasts (UUPC and LO) are quite different in style so we had no idea how well we would integrate. The two podcasts released their own versions of the live show during the following week and, if you&#8217;re keen, you can compare and contrast the two: <a title="UUPC version of the live show" href="http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org/2009/10/28/s02e16-the-ordeal/" target="_blank">UUPC</a> (family friendly) and <a title="Linux Outlaws version of the live show" href="http://linuxoutlaws.com/podcast/119" target="_blank">LO</a> (includes the naughty words). I don&#8217;t think either podcast did much editing of content, which drew <a title="ChemicalOliver comment on raffle" href="http://twitter.com/chemicaloliver/status/5245658030" target="_blank">this comment</a> from a UUPC listener.</p>
<p>So, all in all, I think we can say that OggCamp was a success. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>It was certainly a lot of fun &#8211; if exhausting!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<p>We also sold enough raffle tickets and OggCamp limited edition souvenir mugs to financially break even on the whole event. Which was good from our point of view. And there has been a load of positive feedback from the attendees, including questions about whether we&#8217;ll do it again next year. Although we&#8217;ve tried to not to commit to anything, by now I think we can safely say that there is likely to be another OggCamp next year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday lunchtime the auditorium in Hursley House became the venue of an internal &#8220;unconference&#8221; of sorts &#8211; a very relaxed session with a bunch of short, snappy 5 minute presentations by folks from around the lab who related their experiences from different tech conferences.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/dalelane">Dale Lane</a> spoke about Hackdays and Barcamps; <a href="http://twitter.com/aefaradien">Alex Hutter</a> talked about last weekend&#8217;s Barcamp in Brighton; <a href="http://twitter.com/rewbs">Robin Fernandes</a> talked about user groups and his involvement with PHP; <a href="http://twitter.com/iaingavin">Iain Gavin</a> from Amazon Web Services told us about external views on IBM; and <a href="http://twitter.com/andysc">Andy Stanford-Clark</a> was, well, Andy <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I think he may have mentioned something about some service called Twitter, I was&#8217;t really paying attention&#8230; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Most of it was Ignite-style high-speed babble, and mostly without slides.</p>

<p>It was all the brainchild of the brilliant <a href="http://twitter.com/zoe_slattery">Zoe Slattery</a>, who also had some exciting announcements to share with us (more to come on these once I get clearance to post!). There were guest appearances of photographs by <a href="http://twitter.com/alicebartlett">Alice</a>, too.</p>
<p>Oh, and my contribution? I gave a potted, high-speed history of eightbar from the perspective of someone who jumped in to the Hursley world from the outside. Here&#8217;s a pictorial tour. You&#8217;ll note few mentions of virtual worlds &#8211; not because that&#8217;s not something eightbar does anymore, but rather to remind people of the breadth of our interests. Oh, and guess what, the blog has been around for nearly 4 years &#8211; just a week or so to go!</p>
