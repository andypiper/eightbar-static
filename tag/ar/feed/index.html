				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://andypiper.co.uk/">Andy Piper</a> brought his new toy to the lab today. While on a whistle stop tour of China recently he called in at Hong Kong on the way back, where he picked up one of the a <a href="http://ardrone.parrot.com/parrot-ar-drone/">Parrot AR.Drones</a> which have been released this month.</p>
<p>The AR.Drone is a quadricopter with 2 video cameras, one mounted in the nose and one downward-facing. The drone that acts as an ad-hock Wi-Fi access point allowing it to be controlled from any device with Wi-Fi. At the moment Parrot are only shipping a client for the iPhone, but there is an <a href="https://projects.ardrone.org/">API</a> available and there is already <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oT_OSblo-Og&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">footage</a> on the net using an Android Nexus One to control one. It&#8217;s loaded with a bunch of other sensors as well, an accelerometer to help keep it stable and a ultrasound altimeter to help it maintain altitude over changing ground.</p>
<p>The iPhone interface for flying the drone uses the accelerometer and is a bit tricky to start with, but I think with a little bit of practice it shouldn&#8217;t take too long to get the hang of it. The feed from the video cameras is fed back to the handset allowing you to get a pilot&#8217;s eye view. At the moment none of the software allows you to capture this video, but it&#8217;s expected to be added soon. You can also use the camera to play AR games or have the it hover and hold station over markers on the floor.</p>
<p>The whole thing runs a embedded Linux build on a ARM chip and you can even telnet into the thing. It comes with 2 chassis, one for outside and one with some protective shrouds for the propellers to use indoors. </p>
<p>I think some very cool stuff should be possible with a platform like this.</p>
<p>Here are 2 short videos I short of a few of us having a go with it on the lawn in front of Hursley House.</p>
