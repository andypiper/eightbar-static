				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spurred on by the success of <a href="http://jtlog.wordpress.com/2013/01/04/raspberry-pi-mosquitto/">getting Mosquitto working on a Raspberry Pi</a>, I recently had a play with MQTT on the Joggler. The <a href="http://www.jogglerwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page">O2 Joggler is still a great device for hacking</a> and I currently have <a href="http://birdslikewires.co.uk/articles/squeezeplay-os">SqeezePlay OS</a> running on it.</p>
<p>The reason I wanted to try and get MQTT on the Joggler was to make use of its light sensor, and publish light levels over MQTT. It all turned out to be pretty simple since most of the work has already been done by other people!</p>
<ul>
<li>Andrew de Quincey has <a href="http://code.google.com/p/adqmisc/source/browse/trunk/joggler/readlightsensor.c">code to read the Joggler&#8217;s light sensor</a></li>
<li>Andy Piper has a <a href="http://andypiper.co.uk/2012/03/10/paho-gets-started/">handy quick start guide for Paho</a></li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/paho/files/mqttdoc/Cclient/">MQTT C client documentation</a> has simple publish examples</li>
</ul>
<p>First thing to do was read the light sensor and get that working with an MQTT client. I had to skip some of Andy&#8217;s instructions and just built the client code rather than attempting to get doxygen working. Once I&#8217;d mashed up the light sensor code and publish example I could compile the worlds most pointless MQTT publisher:</p>
<pre>gcc -Wall publightsensor.c -L../bin/linux_ia32 -I../src -lmqttv3c -lpthread -o publightsensor</pre>
<p>Next it was time to check the results. This too was quick and easy thanks to the <a href="http://m2m.eclipse.org/sandbox.html">MQTT sandbox server</a>, which has a handy HTTP bridge. And the final result... was a completely unscientific and <a href="http://m2m-eclipse.cloudfoundry.com/jttest">slightly dingy light level 4</a>! Now I'll be able to turn on a lamp using an unreliable RF controlled socket and see whether it worked or not!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> the code really is all in the existing examples but I've created a Github Gist in case it's any help: <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4753409">mqttjogglermashup.c</a> (11 February 2013)</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/jtlog.wordpress.com/2171/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/jtlog.wordpress.com/2171/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=jtlog.wordpress.com&#038;blog=1751515&%23038;post=2171&%23038;subd=jtlog&%23038;ref=&%23038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p align="center">Just an average day in the Hursley tea bar!</p>
<p>Martin Dix from <a href="http://currentcost.co.uk">CurrentCost</a> visited to deliver a bunch of meters for people who had attended <a href="http://homecamp.org.uk">Home Camp</a> 08. Whilst he was with us, Andy Stanford-Clark hooked up a (battery-powered) meter to one of his mousetraps to show how it is possible to detect traps going off using the meter &#8211; this is the same technique he uses in his automated home system. He also showed the same message arriving in his MQTT broker on his Ubuntu laptop. The table was soon awash with gadgets, wires and tools. I brought along a camera or two, Dale brought along some questions about the software internals of the new devices, and a great time was had by a bunch of geeks over tea&#8230;</p>
<p>No mice were harmed during this meetup, but a few wooden coffee stirrers were put through their paces in some vicious mousetraps.</p>
