				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On friday a contingent of the Hursley Emerging tech crew (a good few of who are founder members of eightbar) gathered in a Hampshire field to have a rocket launching competition. Fellow eightbar Rob Smart has produced this video of the entire event, its features all the key moments including Dave CJ&#8217;s rocket complete with wireless camera to record the flight, and landing (in a tree).<br />
All the rockets were non-explosive, water powered, diet coke powered etc. It was a very good work day out and bonding experience, with a huge dose of geek chic on top of it. There was lots of participation too.</p>

<p>We did this last about 3 years ago, then I remember about 4 cameras. This time it was very well covered in digital form. We have a growing <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/720823@N20/pool/">flickr pool</a> if you are interested.</p>
