Yesterday, at work, the Hursley Linux Special Interest Group ran a little trade show type event for a couple of hours after lunch.  The idea was to provide a bit of away from your desk time for folks around the lab to see what we Linux geeks have been getting up to.  Various people interested in using Linux inside and outside work came along to demo their gadgets.  <br /><br />The picture shows me <i>showing off</i> my old Linux audio centre.  But, also at the event were the main organiser of the day <a href="http://www.coralbark.net/blog/">Jon Levell</a> (showing Fedora 9 and an eeepc), and <a href="http://knolleary.net/">Nick O'Leary</a> (showing his N800 and various arduino gadgets), <a href="http://blog.garethj.com/">Gareth Jones</a> (showing his accelerometer based USB rocket launcher and bluetooth tweetjects), <a href="http://twitter.com/andysc">Andy Stanford-Clark</a> (showing his NSLU2 driven house, and an OLPC), <a href="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/">Laura Cowen</a> (showing an OLPC), <a href="http://twitter.com/SteveGodwin">Steve Godwin</a> (showing MythTV), and Chris law (showing Amora).<br /><br />I thought it was quite a nice little selection of Linux related stuff to look through for the masses of people turning up, plenty of other things we could have shown too of course.  The afternoon seemed very much a success, generating some real interest in the various demo items and lots of interesting questions too.  Thanks to everyone for taking part!]]></content:encoded>
