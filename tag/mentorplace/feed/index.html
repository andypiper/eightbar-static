				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week saw the start of a new year for IBM Hursley&#8217;s MentorPlace programme. The idea of MentorPlace is to connect people from the lab with female students from local schools who might be interested in pursuing a career in one of the STEM areas (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). We work with the girls over the course of the year, providing a weekly email mentoring session, and run some activities on-site to build up their knowledge of different topics and work together in teams. The idea of engaging more with students to help them to learn more about technology and careers is something I&#8217;m personally passionate about, and <a href="http://andypiper.co.uk/2011/09/12/teaching-technology-in-the-future-raspberry-pi/">I wrote about it on my own blog last week</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a lot of fun, and I think the people from the lab get as much out of it as the girls do! Last week&#8217;s activities at Hursley saw 48 students learn some Java coding in the morning, and in the afternoon to build bridges using paper, string, tape, and craft sticks &#8211; they had to support a number of text books in order to be successful. The girls were divided into teams named after different inspirational women in science, technology and other areas of achievement. Here are some of the resulting pieces of work:</p>

<p>All of the bridges performed to the required specification and it was left to the judges to decide which one was the most creative and successful design &#8211; tough job! Looking forward to working with the schools during the academic year&#8230;</p>
