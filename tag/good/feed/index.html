				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A long long time ago&#8230; well OK a couple of years ago&#8230; a few of us from the eightbar crowd / tribe / collective / [insert group adjective of your choice here] were quite into <a href="http://www.perplexcity.com/">Perplex City</a>, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_Reality_Game">Alternate Reality Game</a> from Mind Candy where you had to solve puzzles on game cards related to a parallel world. At the time I was particularly fascinated by the intersection of gaming, virtual and real worlds, and physical / tangible objects and the web.</p>
<p>I was listening to <a href="http://twit.tv/natn85">a podcast</a> the other day and heard about a new ARG &#8211; in this case they brand themselves a <em>Social</em> Reality Game &#8211; called <a href="http://akoha.com/">Akoha</a>. It is also card-based, and has a technology / web tie-in.</p>
<blockquote><p>Akoha is the worldâ€™s first social reality game where you can earn points by playing real-world missions with your friends. Missions might include giving someone your favorite book, inviting a friend for drinks, or buying a friend some chocolate.</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea here is that players will perform good deeds or &#8220;missions&#8221; on the cards in the real world, and then pass the cards on to others who can then join the game by entering the card code on the website. It&#8217;s a fascinating idea. There&#8217;s a social network element. There&#8217;s a physical element (the cards, and the personal / direct social interaction). There&#8217;s an online element. Plus, the whole idea is around improving the way we all interact with each other and our environment (I&#8217;m thinking Smarter Planet).</p>
<p>I love the idea and I&#8217;m definitely going to be following Akoha&#8217;s development. It&#8217;s in closed beta at the moment but anyone can join by getting some cards&#8230; I wonder how widespread it is beyond the US at the moment.</p>
