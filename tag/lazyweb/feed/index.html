				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ll be moderating a panel at Virtual Worlds 2008 on Friday, entitled &#8216;The Evolution of Games and Social Networks&#8217;. To give you an idea of what we&#8217;ll be talking about, the abstract for the panel describes it thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With the planned introduction of Sony&#8217;s Home for the PlayStation3 and multiple virtual worlds providers now creating widgets for Facebook,  Bebo, and other social<br />
networks, we&#8217;re seeing virtual worlds reach out to every part of the Web and consumer life. This session offers a detailed understanding of how virtual worlds are taking advantage of these emerging distribution formats and how you can leverage Virtual Worlds Everywhere.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll be joined on the panel by some very smart and interesting people, including</p>
<ul>
<li>Christian Lassonde, President &#038; Co Founder, Millions of Us
</li>
<li>Susan Panico, Senior Director, PLAYSTATION Network, Sony Computer Entertainment America
</li>
<li>Sean Ryan, CEO, Meez
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Mark Limber from Google was supposed to be joining us, but I understand that he won&#8217;t be able to make it.)</p>
<p>What would you like me to ask them?</p>
<p>The intersection between virtual worlds and social networking is a pretty big and (hopefully) interesting topic, and should be a well attended session. I&#8217;ve been preparing some discussion points and questions for the other panelists, and I&#8217;d love your input. If you won&#8217;t be there in person, here&#8217;s a chance to let me know where you&#8217;d like to see the discussion go. Specific questions for specific panelists or general topics for discussion are both welcomed. Leave a comment on this post. I&#8217;ll be posting the results after the event (audio? text? video? at least one of those anyway), so think of it as a way of participating remotely and asynchronously. Alternatively, think of it as a blatant lazyweb request to make my own life easier. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
