				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If I don&#8217;t post a few notes from today&#8217;s <a href="http://odcamp.org.uk/">Open Data Camp</a> now, I never will, so here are a few things I scribbled down- it could be worse, I could have posted a PDF containing photos of the the actual scribbles!</p>
<p>So <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ag75qK9Aqm79dGNsbDBHVlJKUnFCbjZNb0V4TVZQc3c&amp;usp=sharing#gid=11">out of this choice</a>&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="https://jtlog.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/odcamp-sessions.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2462" src="https://jtlog.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/odcamp-sessions.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="odcamp-sessions" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230;I picked, Open Data for Elections, Open Addresses, Data Literacy, Designing Laws using Open Data, and Augmented Reality for Walkers.</p>
<h1>Open Data for Elections</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ve been following @<a href="https://twitter.com/floppy">floppy</a>&#8216;s crazy plan to get elected for a while, so this was the easiest decision of the day: what drives someone to embrace the gory inner workings of democracy like this?</p>
<p>Falling turnout it would seem, and concern for a functioning democracy.</p>
<p>The first step of his journey was the <a href="http://openpolitics.org.uk/">Open Politics Manifesto</a>, which I&#8217;ve so far failed to edit- must try harder.</p>
<p>Perhaps more interesting was how this, and use of open data, fits into a political platform as a service. It would be nice to have the opportunity to see a few additions to the usual suspects at the ballot box, and Eastleigh got a rare chance to see what that could be like with a by election. Perhaps open data services for candidates could tip he balance enough to encourage more people to stand.</p>
<p>Things that sounded interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://democracyclub.org.uk/">Democracy Club</a></li>
<li><a href="https://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a></li>
<li><a href="http://data.okfn.org/doc/data-package">Data Packages</a></li>
<li>Open data certificates (food hygiene certificates for data?)</li>
<li>Candidates get one free leaflet delivery by Royal Mail- I wonder how big they expect those leaflets to be!</li>
</ul>
<h1>Open Addresses</h1>
<p>@<a href="http://twitter.com/floppy">floppy</a> and @<a href="https://twitter.com/giacecco">giacecco</a> introduced the (huge) problems they need to overcome to rebuild a large data set without polluting that data with any sources with intellectual property restrictions. <a href="https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/">Open Addresses</a> still have a long way to go and there were comments about how long Open Street Map has been around, and it still has gaps.</p>
<p>They have some fun ideas about crowd sourcing address data (high vis jacket required) and there are some interesting philosophical questions around consent for addresses to be added.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see whether Open Addresses can get enough data to provide real value, and what services they build.</p>
<h1>Data Literacy</h1>
<p>Mark and Laura led a discussion around data literacy founded in the observation that competent people, with all the skills you could reasonably expect them to have, still struggle with handling data sets.</p>
<p>Who needs to be data literate? Data scientists? Data professionals? Everyone?</p>
<p>Data plumbers? There were some analogies with actual plumbers! You might not be a plumber but it&#8217;s useful to know something about it.</p>
<p>If we live in a data driven society, we should know how to ask the right questions. Need domain expertise and technical expertise.</p>
<p>Things that sounded interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Data Cookbook</li>
<li><a href="http://opendatahandbook.org/">Open Data Handbook</a></li>
</ul>
<h1>Designing Laws using Open Data</h1>
<p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/johnlsheridan">johnlsheridan</a> pointed out that the least interesting thing to do with legislation is to publish it and went on to share some fascinating insights into the building blocks of statute law. It sounds like the slippery language used in legislation boils down to a small number of design patterns built with simple building blocks, such as a duty along with a claim right, and so on.</p>
<p>Knowing these building blocks makes it easier to get the gist of what laws are trying to achieve, helps navigate statutes, and could give policy makers a more reliable way to effect a goal.</p>
<p>For example, it&#8217;s easier to make sense of the legislation covering supply of gas, and it&#8217;s possible to identify where there may be problems. The gas regulator has a <em>duty</em> to protect the interests of consumers by promoting competition, but that&#8217;s a weak duty without a clear <em>claim right</em> to enforce it.</p>
<p>John also demonstrated a tool &#8211; <a href="http://ngrams.elasticbeanstalk.com/">http://ngrams.elasticbeanstalk.com</a> &#8211; exploring how the language used in legislation has changed over time, for example how the use of &#8220;shall&#8221; has declined and been replaced by &#8220;is to be&#8221;.</p>
<h1>Augmented Reality for Walkers</h1>
<p>My choice of Android tablet was largely based on what might work reasonably well for maps and augmented reality, so I seized this opportunity!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/nickw">Nick Whitelegg</a> described the Hikar Android app he&#8217;s been working on, which is intended to help hikers follow paths by overlaying map data on a live camera feed.</p>
<p>The data is a combination of Open Street Map mapping data, with Ordnance Survey height data, which is downloaded and cached as tiles around your current location. Open GL is used to overlay a 3D view of the map data on the live camera feed, using the Android sensor APIs to detect the device&#8217;s rotation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just downloaded and installed <a href="http://www.free-map.org.uk/downloads/android/hikar-latest.apk">Hikar</a> and, while my tablet is a tad slow, it works really well. I live somewhere flat and boring but the height data made a noticeable difference when Nick demonstrated the app in hilly Winchester.</p>

I live somewhere flat and boring but the height data made a noticeable difference when Nick demonstrated the app in hilly Winchester.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As <a href="http://twitter.com/eightbar/status/9977537541">we tweeted the other day</a>, we have some great stuff coming up in the next few weeks. We&#8217;ll start with a guest post from <a href="http://twitter.com/anghelides">Peter Anghelides</a></p>
<p style="border-top-width: thin; border-top-style: dotted; border-top-color: #FFFFFF;">
<p>There&#8217;s a snappy new website about <a href="http://www.ibmideaslab.co.uk/">IBM&#8217;s Ideas Lab in the UK</a>. It talks about the kind of people who work here, and has links to a virtual tour of the site, a Smarter Planet video, <a href="http://ibmideaslab.blogspot.com/">blogs</a> by recent graduates <a href="http://ibmideaslab.blogspot.com/2010/02/hey-im-ed-i-joined-ibm-in-september.html">Ed</a> and <a href="http://ibmideaslab.blogspot.com/2010/02/introducing-clare-software-developer-at.html">Clare</a>, a simulation game, and some pictures of shoes.</p>
<p><a href="http://ibmideaslab.co.uk"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990" title="ideaslab" src="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ideaslab.jpg" alt="The Ideas Lab" width="485" height="105" srcset="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ideaslab.jpg 485w, http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ideaslab-300x64.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" /></a></p>
<div id="_mcePaste">Welcome to the IBM Ideas Lab &#8211; the recruitment marketing team have been working on a bit of a rebrand of the UK Software Labs in reaching out to students and graduates.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">Check out the microsite <a href="http://www.ibmideaslab.co.uk/">here</a>.  Students and grads can find out about what it is like to work at the labs and some of the cool things that people work on here.  We want to shout about all the fantastic stuff that comes out of the &#8216;Ideas Lab&#8217; and attract males and females from all degree backgrounds into these roles.</div>
<p>So where are all those brilliant biologists, fantastic philosophers, genius geographers, clever chemists, marvellous mathematicians&#8230;? You&#8217;ll have to come up with your own descriptions for English, History, Psychology&#8230; but they should apply, too.</p>
<p style="border-top-width: thin; border-top-style: dotted; border-top-color: #FFFFFF;">
<p>[oi! I&#8217;m an historian thanks very much Peter! &#8230; hmm&#8230; enlightened English graduates? psuper psychologists? hintelligent historians&#8230;? &#8211; <a href="http://twitter.com/andypiper">Andy</a> &#8230; and if you want to read more about what life is like at Hursley, there was a lovely piece <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/technology/article7052560.ece">in the Sunday Times &#8220;Inside the IBM Dream Factory&#8221;</a> a couple of weekends back]</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[thanks to the brilliant <a href="http://lauracowen.co.uk">Laura Cowen</a>, producer of the <a href="http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org/">Ubuntu UK Podcast</a> and uber UX god at Hursley, for writing up this event – it’s a shame I wasn’t able to make it!]</p>
<p>As is usually the case when I&#8217;m attending a HantsLUG (<a href="http://hants.lug.org.uk">Hampshire Linux User Group</a><a href="http://hants.lug.org.uk)">)</a> meeting, it was a lovely sunny day on Saturday. It&#8217;s like as if it knows that I&#8217;m going to be spending the day inside, geeking in front of a laptop screen. This meeting, however, we put the sun to good use, first of all showing off Hursley Park at its best, and then lunching out on the decking at the Clubhouse.</p>
<p>When I was a more frequent attendee of the HantsLUG bring-a-box meetings (where I installed my first <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> distro, and later my first <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>), I&#8217;d often thought how cool it would be to host a meeting at IBM Hursley. But I never got as far as investigating the security and wifi hassles I&#8217;d have to overcome. Fortunately, <a href="http://www.strangeparty.com/">Anton Piatek</a> was a little braver and sent some emails to nearly the right people (who helpfully forwarded them on to really the right people), and suggested his plan to <a href="http://hants.lug.org.uk/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?AdamTrickett">Adam Trickett</a>, Chair of HantsLUG. Adam says he nearly bit Anton&#8217;s hand off and so it happened.</p>
<p>HantsLUG is one of the biggest LUGs in the UK and is our local Linux user group but has surprisingly never really (in the 7 years I&#8217;ve known them) had a huge amount of interaction with IBM Hursley. For a long time, though, there has been a good pool of Linux skills and interest in the Lab, and over the last couple of years the number of people around the Lab voluntarily using Linux as their desktop OS has risen (as has the number of Ubuntu lanyards to be seen as you walk the corridors of Hursley).</p>

<p>So what makes Hursley a good place for a LUG meeting? Well, for a start, it&#8217;s just a really nice place to be &#8211; and Hursley House as well as the Park are very impressive to show off to visitors <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>On Saturday, we were mostly in the Auditorium (where Spitfires were built during WWII), then when we led everyone down to the Clubhouse for lunch, we took the usual site tour scenic route via the Sunken Garden and fish pond. Although Hursley is out in the country, seemingly the middle of nowhere, it&#8217;s actually on the bus-route from Winchester so we had an excellent turnout of about 30 people. IBM Hursley also has a lot of cool people who do cool things that we can tell people about (although one piece of feedback I heard from a LUG person was that they thought we didn&#8217;t talk enough about what IBM does!).</p>

<p>Although we had the House to ourselves, and everyone was free to stand around and chat in the Main Hall, most of the day revolved around talks in the Auditorium. It all kicked off at 11am with an introduction to IBM Hursley (and, of course, directions to the fire exits and toilets) from Anton. The inimitable <a href="http://www.twitter.com/andysc">Andy Stanford-Clark</a>, fresh from a week of press interviews, enthused everyone till lunchtime with tales of mouse traps, <a href="http://mqtt.org">MQTT</a>, twittering houses, twittering ferries, water meters, and energy monitoring. I say &#8216;enthused&#8217; but there must be a better term to describe the way the audience rushed the stage when Andy offered to sell <a href="http://www.currentcost.com">Current Cost</a> monitors at a discount&#8230;</p>
<p>After lunch, we had a collection of shorter talks on a range of topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>I talked about <a href="http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4042">InfoSlicer</a>, the open source software that my <a href="http://www-05.ibm.com/employment/uk/extreme-blue/">Extreme Blue student team</a> developed last Summer and IBM released under the GPL</li>
<li>Anton described the anatomy of Ubuntu packages (he&#8217;s the guy that provides Ubuntu users in IBM with the flawless packages we&#8217;ve come to rely on)</li>
<li><a href="http://tonywhitmore.co.uk">Tony Whitmore</a> related his experiences of producing the popular <a href="http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org">Ubuntu UK Podcast</a> &#8211; and pimped the upcoming <a href="http://oggcamp.org/">OggCamp unconference</a></li>
<li>Adam Trickett, Chair of HantsLUG, gave out free books in return for promises of book reviews on the HantsLUG wiki</li>
</ul>
<p>Then everyone just hung around chatting for ages.</p>
<p>It was a really enjoyable and relaxed day; kudos to Anton, Stephen, and John for organising it from the IBM end. Thanks also to the IBMers who came along and to the many HantsLUG members who turned up. I&#8217;d say it was a success and we should definitely do it again.</p>
