				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the last of <a href="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?tag=w4a2013">four posts</a> sharing some of the things I saw while at the <a href="http://www2013.org/">International World Wide Web Conference</a> for <a href="http://www.w4a.info/2013/">w4a</a>. </p>
<p>Several presentations looked at how accessible the web is. </p>
<p><strong>Web Accessibility Snapshot</strong></p>
<p>In 2006, an <a href="http://www.un.org/disabilities/documents/fnomensarep.pdf">audit was performed by Nomensa for the United Nations</a>. They reviewed 100 popular websites for conformance to accessibility guidelines. </p>
<p>The results weren&#8217;t positive: 97% of sites didn&#8217;t meet WCAG level 1. </p>
<p>Obviously, conformance to guidelines doesn&#8217;t mean a site is accessible, but it&#8217;s an important factor. It&#8217;s not sufficient, but it is required. Conformance to guidelines can&#8217;t prove that a website is accessible, however there are some guidelines that we can be certain would break accessibility if not followed. So they are at least a useful starting point. </p>
<p>However, 2006 is a long time ago now, and the Internet has changed a lot since. One project, from colleagues of mine at IBM, is creating <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/giyw9zubmbsgjm2/spCsgE99PL/communications/p39-figueredo-snapshot.pdf">a more up to date picture of the state of the web</a>. They analysed a thousand of the most popular websites (according to <a href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites">Alexa</a>) as well as a random sampling of a thousand other sites. </p>
<p>(Interestingly, they found no statistically significant difference between conformance in the most popular websites and the randomly selected ones). </p>
<p>Their intention is to perform this regularly, creating a Web Accessibility Snapshot, with regular updates on the status of accessibility of the web. It looks like it could become a valuable source of information. </p>

</p><p><strong>Assessing accessibility</strong></p>
<p>There was a lot of discussion about how to assess accessibility. </p>
<p>One paper argued <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/giyw9zubmbsgjm2/V_Qo7toIQ2/full-papers/p18-vigo.pdf">there is an over-reliance on automated tools and a lack of awareness of the negative effects</a> of this. They demonstrated a manual review of websites, comparing results with output from six popular tools. Their results showed how few accessibility problems automated tools discover. </p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/21092809" width="427" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen> </iframe>
<div style="margin-bottom:5px"> <strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/markel_vigo/benchmarking-web-accessibility-evaluation-tools-measuring-the-harm-of-sole-reliance-on-automated-tests" title="Benchmarking Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools: Measuring the Harm of Sole Reliance on Automated Tests" >Benchmarking Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools: Measuring the Harm of Sole Reliance on Automated Tests</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/markel_vigo" >markel_vigo</a></strong> </div>
</p><p>Accurately assessing a website against accessibility guidelines doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that you can prove a site is accessible or easy to use. </p>
<p>Some research presented suggests guidelines only cover a little over half of problems encountered by users. Usability studies suggest some websites that don&#8217;t meet guidelines may be easier to use than websites that do, as users may have effective coping strategies for (technically) non-compliant sites. This suggests we need a better way of assessing accessibility. </p>
<p>A better approach might be to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/giyw9zubmbsgjm2/dwcJYs04L8/communications/p19-vigo.pdf">observe users interact with a website and assess based on their experiences</a>. One tool presented, WebTactics, showed an automated approach to assessing accessibility by observing a user and identifying behaviours they employ. </p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/21093096" width="427" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen> </iframe>

</p><p>Another paper detailed how to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/giyw9zubmbsgjm2/KeWLhAxj6_/communications/p16-apaolaza.pdf">add accessibility monitoring to a live website</a> by adding additional JavaScript that captures and evaluates mouse clicks and button presses client-side before submitting them to a server for processing. Instead of requiring the user to perform predefined, and perhaps artificial, tasks, they hope to be able to discover tasks implicitly &#8211; that common tasks will emerge from the low-level actions that they collect. </p>

</p><p><strong>Accessibility training</strong></p>
<p>Given that most websites have some sort of accessibility problems, there was some talk about how this could be improved. </p>
<p>One project presented showed <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/giyw9zubmbsgjm2/r0gzcj1RFV/communications/p52-wood.pdf">training that has been developed</a> to raise awareness of how people with disabilities access the web, and the implications of the accessibility guidelines. It&#8217;s a practical course including hands-on assignments, and looks like it could be the sort of thing that could help web developers make a real difference. </p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/21473764" width="427" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen> </iframe>

</p><p><strong>Social Accessibility</strong></p>
<p>Another project is using crowd-sourcing to improve web sites that already exist. <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/social/projects_sap.shtml">Social Accessibility</a>, another IBM project, enables volunteers to make web pages more accessible to the visually impaired. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/trl/projects/acc_tech/index_e.htm"><img src="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/post-images/130529-socialaccessibility.gif" border=0/></a></p>
<p>It provides a mechanism for accessibility problems to be gathered directly from visually impaired users. Volunteers are then notified, and can respond using a tool that allows them to externally modify web pages to make them more accessible. It lets them publish metadata associated with the original web page. This can be applied to the web page for all visually impaired users who visit it in future using this tool, so that many users can benefit from the improvement.  </p>
<p><strong>cloud4all</strong></p>
<p>Finally, a project called <a href="http://www.cloud4all.info/">cloud4all</a> is developing a roaming profile that stores your preferences in a way that multiple services can access. The focus is on accessibility &#8211; a user can store their accessibility needs in one place, and then interfaces can use this to adapt for them. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the third of <a href="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?tag=w4a2013">four posts</a> sharing some of the things I saw while at the <a href="http://www2013.org/">International World Wide Web Conference</a> for <a href="http://www.w4a.info/2013/">w4a</a>. </p>
<p>There were a few sessions presenting work done to improve understanding of how to better support people with dyslexia. </p>
<p>One interesting study investigated the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/giyw9zubmbsgjm2/s7M42rdHtg/full-papers/p43-rello-sizematters.pdf">effect of font size and line spacing on the readibility</a> of wikipedia articles. </p>
<p>This was assessed in a variety of ways, some of which were based on the reader&#8217;s opinions, while others were based on measurements made of the reader during reading and of their understanding of the content after. The underlying question (can we make Wikipedia easier to read for dyslexics?) was compelling. It was also interesting to see this performed not on abstract passages of text, but in the context of using an actual website. </p>
<p>Accessibility isn&#8217;t just about the presentation but also the content itself. Another study looked at <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/giyw9zubmbsgjm2/RQcoc6Ai91/full-papers/p28-rello-simplify.pdf">strategies for simplifying text that could make web pages more readable for dyslexic readers</a>. </p>
<p>It compared the effectiveness of two strategies: firstly, providing synonyms on demand &#8211; giving a reader a way to be able to request an alternative for any word. The second was providing synonyms automatically &#8211; with complex words automatically substituted for simpler equivalents. Again, this was assessed in several ways, such as the speed of reading, the reader&#8217;s comprehension, on the reader&#8217;s opinion of easiness, on the effort it took (e.g. interpreting facial expression, etc.), on fixation duration measured using eye tracking, and so on. </p>
<p>On a more practical note, there were also tools presented that are being created to help support people with dyslexia. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/giyw9zubmbsgjm2/90LbJGgMww/communications/p36-figueredo-firefixia.pdf">Firefixia</a> is a Firefox toolbar extension being created by colleagues of mine in IBM. It provides options for users to customise the web page they are looking at, offering modifications that have been demonstrated to make it easier for dyslexic users. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the second of <a href="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?tag=w4a2013">four posts</a> sharing some of the things I saw while at the <a href="http://www2013.org/">International World Wide Web Conference</a> for <a href="http://www.w4a.info/2013/">w4a</a>. </p>
<p>Several of the projects that I saw showed glimpses of a possible future for screen readers. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?s=screenreader">written about screen readers before</a>, and some of the challenges with using them. </p>
<p><strong>Interactive SIGHT</strong></p>
<p>One project interpreted pictures of charts or graphs and created a textual summary of the information shown in them. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m still amazed at this. It takes a picture of a graph, not the original raw data, and generates sensible summaries of what it shows. </p>
<p>For example, given this image:</p>
<p><img src="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/post-images/130529-sight-graph1.png"/></p>
<p>It can generate:</p>
<blockquote><p>This graphic is about United States. The graphic shows that  United States at 35 thousand dollars is the third highest with respect to the dollar value of gross domestic product per capita 2001 among the countries listed. Luxembourg at 44.2 thousand dollars is the highest</p></blockquote>
<p>or </p>
<blockquote><p>The dollar value of gross domestic product per capita 2001 is 25 thousand dollars for Britain, which has the lowest dollar value of product per capita 2001. United States has 1.4 times more product per capita 2001 than Britain. The difference between the dollar value of gross domestic product per capita 2001 for United States and that for Britain is 10 thousand dollars. </p></blockquote>
<p>The original version was able to process bar graphs, and was <a href="http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~ejschwar/papers/w4a10.pdf">presented to W4A in 2010</a>. What I saw was an extension that added <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/giyw9zubmbsgjm2/rAJ50TZG-T/full-papers/p6-moraes.pdf">support for line graphs</a>.</p>
<p>Their focus is on the sort of graphics found in newspapers and magazines &#8211; informational, rather than scientific graphs. They want to be able to generate a high level summary, rather than a list of plot points that require the user to build a mental model in order to interpret. </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><img src="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/post-images/130529-sight-graph3.png"/></p>
<blockquote><p>The image shows a line graph. The line graph presents the number of Walmmartâ€™s sales of leather jackets. The line graph shows a trend that changes. The changing trend consists of a rising trend from 1997 to 1999 followed by a falling trend through 2006. The first segment is the rising trend. The rising trend is steep. The rising trend has a starting value of 1890. The rising trend has an ending value of 36840. The second segment is the falling trend. The falling trend has a starting value of 36840. The falling trend has an ending value of 12606.</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/post-images/130529-sight-graph4.png"/></p>
<blockquote><p>The image shows a line graph. The line graph presents the number of people who started smoking under the age of 18 in the US. The line graph shows a trend that changes. The changing trend consists of a rising trend from 1962 to 1966 followed by a falling trend through 1980. The first segment is the rising trend. The rising trend is steep. The second segment is the falling trend.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s able to interpret an image and recognise trends, recognise how noisy or smooth it is, recognise if the trend changes, and more. Impressive. </p>
<p><strong>Interpreting data in tables</strong></p>
<p>Another project demonstrated <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/giyw9zubmbsgjm2/3toi3w-9HY/communications/p38-lai.pdf">restructuring data tables in web pages to make them easier to explore</a> with a screenreader. </p>
<p>They have an interesting approach of analysing an HTML table and reorganising it to make it more accessible, abstracting out complex sections into a series of menus. </p>
<p>For example, given a table such as this:</p>
<p><img src="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/post-images/130529-tables-1.png"/></p>
<p>it can produce navigable menus such as this:</p>
<p><img src="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/post-images/130529-tables-2.png"/></p>
<p>Even quite complex tables, with row and column spans, which would otherwise be quite difficult to interpret if read row-by-row by a screenreader, is made much more accessible. </p>
<p><strong>Capti web player</strong></p>
<p>Another technology I saw demonstrated was the <a href="http://www.ra.ethz.ch/CDstore/www2012/W4A/03%20-%20Microsoft%20Accessibility%20Challenge/borodin.pdf">Capti web player</a>. </p>
<p>Tools such as <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">instapaper</a> and <a href="http://getpocket.com/">read it later</a> have showed that we can take most web pages and extract the body text for the article on the page. </p>
<p>This capability should be ideal for visually impaired users, but the tools themselves are still quite difficult to use and integrate poorly with assistive technologies. Someone described them as obviously &#8220;designed by sighted people for sighted people&#8221;. </p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/capti-web-player/id437052502?mt=8">Capti combines this capability with an accessible media player</a> making it easy to navigate through an article, move through a list of articles, and so on. To a sighted user like me, it looked like they&#8217;ve mashed together instapaper with an audiobook-type media player. I often listen to podcasts while I go running, and am a heavy user of pocket and Safari&#8217;s reading list. So this looks ideal for me. </p>
<p><strong>Multiple simultaneous audio streams</strong></p>
<p>Finally, one fascinating project looked at how to make it quicker to scan large amounts of content with a screenreader to find a specific piece of information. I&#8217;ve <a href="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=2192">written before that relying on a screenreader</a> (which creates a sequential audio representation of the information on the page, starting at the beginning and going through the contents) can be tremendously time-consuming, and that it results in visually impaired users taking considerably more time to find information on the web. </p>
<p>This project investigated whether this could be improved by <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/giyw9zubmbsgjm2/GB-xw6t33K/google-awards/jguerreiro.pdf">using multiple simultaneous sound sources</a>. </p>
<p>It sounds mad, but they&#8217;re starting from observations such as the cocktail party effect &#8211; that in a noisy room with several conversations going on, we&#8217;re able to pick out a specific conversation that we want to listen for. Or that a student not paying attention in a lecture will hear if a lecturer says something like &#8220;this will be on the exam&#8221;. </p>
<p>They&#8217;re looking at a variety of approaches, such as separating the channels directionally, so one audio stream will sound like it&#8217;s coming from the left, while another is in front. Or having different voices, such as different genders, for the different streams. It&#8217;s an intriguing idea, and I&#8217;d love to see if it could be useful.</p>

<p>Last month I went to the <a href="http://www2013.org/">International World Wide Web Conference</a> for <a href="http://www.w4a.info/2013/">w4a</a>. I saw a lot of cool web technologies and accessibility projects while I was there, so thought I would share links to some of the more interesting bits. </p>
<p>There are too many to put in a single post, so I&#8217;ll write <a href="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?tag=w4a2013">a few posts</a> to cover them all. </p>
<p><strong>Subtitles</strong> </p>
<p>Subtitles and transcripts came up a few times. One study presented looked at online video, comparing <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/giyw9zubmbsgjm2/VR6uUZ04CT/communications/p41-kushalnagar.pdf">single-line subtitle captions overlaid on the video with multi-line off-screen transcripts</a> adjacent to it. </p>
<p>It examined which is more effective from a variety of perspectives, including readability, reader enjoyment, the effect on understanding and so on. In summary, it found that overlaid captions are generally better, although transcripts are better for content which is more technical. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dalelane/8877797446/"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3811/8877797446_653724341e_n.jpg" alt="Real-time transcription from a stenographer at W4A" width="320" height="157" /></a></p>
<p>We had subtitles for all the talks and presentations. Impressively, a separate screen projected a live transcription of the speaker. For deaf attendees, it allowed them to follow what the speaker was saying. For talks given in Portuguese, the English subtitles allowed non-Portuguese speakers like me to understand. </p>
<p>They did this by having live stenographers listening to an audio feed from the talks. This is apparently expensive as stenography is a skilled expertise, and it needs to be scheduled in advance. It&#8217;s perhaps only practical for larger conferences.</p>
<p><strong>Legion Scribe</strong></p>
<p>This was the motivation for one of the more impressive projects that I saw presented : <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/giyw9zubmbsgjm2/jZZX7fXmiw/TPG-challenge/lasecki.pdf">Legion Scribe</a>, which <a href="http://hci.cs.rochester.edu/currentprojects.php?proj=scb">crowd-sourced real-time captioning</a> so that you wouldn&#8217;t need an expert stenographer. </p>
<p>Instead, a real-time audio stream is chopped up into short bits, and divided amongst a number of people using <a href="https://www.mturk.com/">Mechanical Turk</a>. Each worker has to type the short phrase fragment they are given. The fragments overlap, so captions that each worker types can be stitched back together to form captions for the whole original audio stream.</p>
<p><a href="http://hci.cs.rochester.edu/projectpages/pics/scribe_system.png"><img src="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/post-images/130529-scribe-arch.png" border=0/></a></p>
<p>All of this is done quickly enough to make the captions appear more or less in real-time. </p>
<p>Seriously impressive. </p>
<p>And they&#8217;re getting reasonable levels of coverage and accuracy. The system has been designed so that workers don&#8217;t need to be experts in the domain that they&#8217;re transcribing, as they&#8217;re only asked to type in a few words at a time not whole passages. With enough people, it works. If they have at least seven workers, it&#8217;s approaching the coverage you can get with a professional stenographer. </p>
<p><a href="http://hci.cs.rochester.edu/projectpages/pics/scribe_graph.png"><img src="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/post-images/130529-scribe-coverage.png" border=0/></a></p>
<p>Assuming that Mechanical Turk can provide a plentiful supply of workers, then this would not only be cheaper than a stenographer, but also let you start captioning at a moments notice, rather than needing to arrange for a stenographer in advance. </p>
<p><strong>Map Reduce in the browser</strong></p>
<p>Speaking of crowd-sourcing, the idea of splitting up a large computing task between a large number of volunteer computers isn&#8217;t new. <a href="http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/">SETI@home</a> is perhaps the best known, while <a href="http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/">World Community Grid</a> is a recent example from IBM. </p>
<p>But these need users to install custom client software to receive the task, perform it and submit the results. </p>
<p>One project showed how <a href="http://www2013.org/companion/p253.pdf">this could be done in web browsers</a>. A large computing task is divided up into map reduce jobs, which are made available through a website. Each web browser that visits the website becomes a map reduce worker, running their task in the background using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Performance/Using_web_workers">web workers</a>. As long as the user remains on the site, their browser can continue to contribute to the overall task in the background, without the user having had to install custom client software. </p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='450' height='284' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/kRZ8E4FGlTw?version=3&#038;rel=1&%23038;fs=1&%23038;showsearch=0&%23038;showinfo=1&%23038;iv_load_policy=1&%23038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an elegant idea. Not all sites would be well suited to it, but there are plenty of web sites that I keep open all day (e.g. GMail, Remember The Milk, Google Calendar, etc.) so I think the idea has potential. </p>
<p><strong>Migrating browser sessions</strong></p>
<p>An interesting project I saw showed how <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~wohlstad/imagen.pdf">the state of a browser app could be migrated from one browser to another</a>, potentially a different browser running on a different machine even a different platform. </p>
<p>This is more than just the client-server session, which you could migrate by transferring cookies. They&#8217;re transferring the entire state of dynamic AJAX-y pages: what bits are open, enabled, and so on, for any arbitrary web app. </p>
<p>Essentially, they started by wanting to be able to serialize the contents of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window">window</a>, so that it could transferred to another browser where it could be used to restore from. </p>
<p>That wouldn&#8217;t be enough. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window">window</a> doesn&#8217;t have access to local variables in functions, it wouldn&#8217;t have access to most event listeners such as those added with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget.addEventListener">addEventListener</a>, it wouldn&#8217;t have access to the contents of some HTML5 tags like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/HTML/Canvas">canvas</a>, it wouldn&#8217;t have access to events scheduled with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.setTimeout">setTimeout</a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.setInterval">setInterval</a>, and so on. </p>
<p>Serializing <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window">window</a> gets you the current state of the DOM which is a good start, but not sufficient to transfer the state for most web apps. </p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~wohlstad/imagenVideo.html">prototype system called Imagen</a> shows how this could be done. Looking at how they&#8217;ve implemented it, they&#8217;ve had to resort to using a proxy server which intercepts JavaScript going to the browser and instruments it with enough additional calls to let them access all of the stuff that wouldn&#8217;t normally be in scope. This is enough for them to be able to serialize the entire state of the page. </p>
<p>I can see a lot of uses for this, such as in testing, debugging or service scenarios, as well as just the convenience of being able to resume work in progress as you move between devices. </p>
<p><strong>Inferring constraints on REST API query parameters</strong></p>
<p>Many web services include constraints and dependencies for the query parameters. For example: &#8220;this option is always required&#8221;, &#8220;that parameter is optional&#8221;, or &#8220;you have to specify at least one of this or that&#8221;. For example, the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/statuses/user_timeline">twitter API docs</a> explain how you have to specify a user_id or screen_name when requesting a user timeline. </p>
<p>One project I saw was an attempt to <a href="http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/txie/publications/www13-constraints.pdf">automatically infer these rules and dependencies</a> through a combination of natural language processing to recognise them in API documentation, and automated source code analysis of sample code provided for web services. It combines these into an estimated model of the constraints in the REST APIs, which are then verified by submitting requests to the API. </p>
<p>They demonstrated it on APIs like twitter, flickr, last.fm, and amazon, and it was surprisingly effective. </p>
<p><strong>duolingo</strong></p>
<p>Finally, there was a keynote talk on Wednesday by the founder of <a href="http://duolingo.com/">duolingo</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/whyrecaptcha">Captcha</a> is particularly interesting because it uses a task that people need to do anyway (verify that they&#8217;re human) to crowd-source the completion of a task that needs to be done (digitise the text of old books that cannot be read by automated OCR). </p>
<p>Duolingo is similar. It takes a task that people need to do, which is to learn a new language, and uses that effort to translate texts into different languages. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s better explained by their demo video.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='450' height='284' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/WyzJ2Qq9Abs?version=3&#038;rel=1&%23038;fs=1&%23038;showsearch=0&%23038;showinfo=1&%23038;iv_load_policy=1&%23038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been around for a little while, but I&#8217;d not come across it before. Since getting back from www, I&#8217;ve been trying it out. Even Grace has been using it to improve her French and seems to be getting on really well with it.</p>
<p><strong>What else?</strong></p>
<p>There were a lot of other cool projects and technologies that I saw, so I&#8217;ll follow this up with another post or two to share some more links.</p>

<p>Last month I went to the <a href="http://www2013.org/">International World Wide Web Conference</a> for <a href="http://www.w4a.info/2013/">w4a</a>. I saw a lot of cool web technologies and accessibility projects while I was there, so thought I would share links to some of the more interesting bits. </p>
<p>There are too many to put in a single post, so I&#8217;ll write <a href="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?tag=w4a2013">a few posts</a> to cover them all. </p>
<p><strong>Subtitles</strong> </p>
<p>Subtitles and transcripts came up a few times. One study presented looked at online video, comparing <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/giyw9zubmbsgjm2/VR6uUZ04CT/communications/p41-kushalnagar.pdf">single-line subtitle captions overlaid on the video with multi-line off-screen transcripts</a> adjacent to it. </p>
<p>It examined which is more effective from a variety of perspectives, including readability, reader enjoyment, the effect on understanding and so on. In summary, it found that overlaid captions are generally better, although transcripts are better for content which is more technical. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dalelane/8877797446/"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3811/8877797446_653724341e_n.jpg" alt="Real-time transcription from a stenographer at W4A" width="320" height="157" /></a></p>
<p>We had subtitles for all the talks and presentations. Impressively, a separate screen projected a live transcription of the speaker. For deaf attendees, it allowed them to follow what the speaker was saying. For talks given in Portuguese, the English subtitles allowed non-Portuguese speakers like me to understand. </p>
<p>They did this by having live stenographers listening to an audio feed from the talks. This is apparently expensive as stenography is a skilled expertise, and it needs to be scheduled in advance. It&#8217;s perhaps only practical for larger conferences.</p>
<p><strong>Legion Scribe</strong></p>
<p>This was the motivation for one of the more impressive projects that I saw presented : <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/giyw9zubmbsgjm2/jZZX7fXmiw/TPG-challenge/lasecki.pdf">Legion Scribe</a>, which <a href="http://hci.cs.rochester.edu/currentprojects.php?proj=scb">crowd-sourced real-time captioning</a> so that you wouldn&#8217;t need an expert stenographer. </p>
<p>Instead, a real-time audio stream is chopped up into short bits, and divided amongst a number of people using <a href="https://www.mturk.com/">Mechanical Turk</a>. Each worker has to type the short phrase fragment they are given. The fragments overlap, so captions that each worker types can be stitched back together to form captions for the whole original audio stream.</p>

<p>All of this is done quickly enough to make the captions appear more or less in real-time. </p>
<p>Seriously impressive. </p>
<p>And they&#8217;re getting reasonable levels of coverage and accuracy. The system has been designed so that workers don&#8217;t need to be experts in the domain that they&#8217;re transcribing, as they&#8217;re only asked to type in a few words at a time not whole passages. With enough people, it works. If they have at least seven workers, it&#8217;s approaching the coverage you can get with a professional stenographer. </p>
<p><a href="http://hci.cs.rochester.edu/projectpages/pics/scribe_graph.png"><img src="http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/post-images/130529-scribe-coverage.png" border=0/></a></p>
<p>Assuming that Mechanical Turk can provide a plentiful supply of workers, then this would not only be cheaper than a stenographer, but also let you start captioning at a moments notice, rather than needing to arrange for a stenographer in advance. </p>
<p><strong>Map Reduce in the browser</strong></p>
<p>Speaking of crowd-sourcing, the idea of splitting up a large computing task between a large number of volunteer computers isn&#8217;t new. <a href="http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/">SETI@home</a> is perhaps the best known, while <a href="http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/">World Community Grid</a> is a recent example from IBM. </p>
<p>But these need users to install custom client software to receive the task, perform it and submit the results. </p>
<p>One project showed how <a href="http://www2013.org/companion/p253.pdf">this could be done in web browsers</a>. A large computing task is divided up into map reduce jobs, which are made available through a website. Each web browser that visits the website becomes a map reduce worker, running their task in the background using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Performance/Using_web_workers">web workers</a>. As long as the user remains on the site, their browser can continue to contribute to the overall task in the background, without the user having had to install custom client software. </p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='450' height='284' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/kRZ8E4FGlTw?version=3&#038;rel=1&%23038;fs=1&%23038;autohide=2&%23038;showsearch=0&%23038;showinfo=1&%23038;iv_load_policy=1&%23038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an elegant idea. Not all sites would be well suited to it, but there are plenty of web sites that I keep open all day (e.g. GMail, Remember The Milk, Google Calendar, etc.) so I think the idea has potential. </p>
<p><strong>Migrating browser sessions</strong></p>
<p>An interesting project I saw showed how <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~wohlstad/imagen.pdf">the state of a browser app could be migrated from one browser to another</a>, potentially a different browser running on a different machine even a different platform. </p>
<p>This is more than just the client-server session, which you could migrate by transferring cookies. They&#8217;re transferring the entire state of dynamic AJAX-y pages: what bits are open, enabled, and so on, for any arbitrary web app. </p>
<p>Essentially, they started by wanting to be able to serialize the contents of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window">window</a>, so that it could transferred to another browser where it could be used to restore from. </p>
<p>That wouldn&#8217;t be enough. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window">window</a> doesn&#8217;t have access to local variables in functions, it wouldn&#8217;t have access to most event listeners such as those added with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget.addEventListener">addEventListener</a>, it wouldn&#8217;t have access to the contents of some HTML5 tags like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/HTML/Canvas">canvas</a>, it wouldn&#8217;t have access to events scheduled with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.setTimeout">setTimeout</a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.setInterval">setInterval</a>, and so on. </p>
<p>Serializing <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window">window</a> gets you the current state of the DOM which is a good start, but not sufficient to transfer the state for most web apps. </p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~wohlstad/imagenVideo.html">prototype system called Imagen</a> shows how this could be done. Looking at how they&#8217;ve implemented it, they&#8217;ve had to resort to using a proxy server which intercepts JavaScript going to the browser and instruments it with enough additional calls to let them access all of the stuff that wouldn&#8217;t normally be in scope. This is enough for them to be able to serialize the entire state of the page. </p>
<p>I can see a lot of uses for this, such as in testing, debugging or service scenarios, as well as just the convenience of being able to resume work in progress as you move between devices. </p>
<p><strong>Inferring constraints on REST API query parameters</strong></p>
<p>Many web services include constraints and dependencies for the query parameters. For example: &#8220;this option is always required&#8221;, &#8220;that parameter is optional&#8221;, or &#8220;you have to specify at least one of this or that&#8221;. For example, the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/statuses/user_timeline">twitter API docs</a> explain how you have to specify a user_id or screen_name when requesting a user timeline. </p>
<p>One project I saw was an attempt to <a href="http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/txie/publications/www13-constraints.pdf">automatically infer these rules and dependencies</a> through a combination of natural language processing to recognise them in API documentation, and automated source code analysis of sample code provided for web services. It combines these into an estimated model of the constraints in the REST APIs, which are then verified by submitting requests to the API. </p>
<p>They demonstrated it on APIs like twitter, flickr, last.fm, and amazon, and it was surprisingly effective. </p>
<p><strong>duolingo</strong></p>
<p>Finally, there was a keynote talk on Wednesday by the founder of <a href="http://duolingo.com/">duolingo</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/whyrecaptcha">Captcha</a> is particularly interesting because it uses a task that people need to do anyway (verify that they&#8217;re human) to crowd-source the completion of a task that needs to be done (digitise the text of old books that cannot be read by automated OCR). </p>
<p>Duolingo is similar. It takes a task that people need to do, which is to learn a new language, and uses that effort to translate texts into different languages. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s better explained by their demo video.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been around for a little while, but I&#8217;d not come across it before. Since getting back from www, I&#8217;ve been trying it out. Even Grace has been using it to improve her French and seems to be getting on really well with it.</p>
<p><strong>What else?</strong></p>
<p>There were a lot of other cool projects and technologies that I saw, so I&#8217;ll follow this up with another post or two to share some more links.</p>
