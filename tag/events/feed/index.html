				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://eightbar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/chcalendar.jpg" width="266" height="200" alt="Chinese Calendar" style="float:left; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:10px;" /></p>
<p>Hursley is a culturally as well as a technically diverse place, so we&#8217;ve got some great opportunities to learn from each other. This lunchtime I popped along to one of the events organised by the lab&#8217;s Chinese Connect team, which was all about Understanding the Chinese Calendar (the title of the post refers to a significant date this week in that calendar, September 23rd).</p>
<p>Previous talks in the Chinese Culture series, which is organised by Hursley&#8217;s Jenny He, have covered subjects such as the evolution of the Chinese languages, how to understand Chinese names, and Chinese music and instruments. I&#8217;m embarrassed to say that this is the first of the talks I&#8217;ve been to, despite working here for some time&#8230; I really should take more advantage of the range of activities and opportunities that Hursley has to offer!</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s talk was delivered by Darren Beard, who was particularly interested in the astronomical background to the Chinese calendar (having <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999JBAA..109...70B">published a paper on the same topic</a> several years ago). Darren covered the scientific background of this <i>lunisolar</i> calendar, and the changes that have taken place to it historically over the ~3500 years it has been around &#8211; particularly interesting to me, since I&#8217;m a historian by background. It&#8217;s a complicated system which takes account of 19 year lunar cycles, requires things like leap months, and has a set of rules which specify how it works&#8230; but it is certainly more comprehensible once you understand those aspects. It was interesting to realise just how much my own perceptions of time are based on the calendar system I&#8217;ve grown up with!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[thanks to the brilliant <a href="http://lauracowen.co.uk">Laura Cowen</a>, producer of the <a href="http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org/">Ubuntu UK Podcast</a> and uber UX god at Hursley, for writing up this event â€“ itâ€™s a shame I wasnâ€™t able to make it!]</p>
<p>As is usually the case when I&#8217;m attending a HantsLUG (<a href="http://hants.lug.org.uk">Hampshire Linux User Group</a><a href="http://hants.lug.org.uk)">)</a> meeting, it was a lovely sunny day on Saturday. It&#8217;s like as if it knows that I&#8217;m going to be spending the day inside, geeking in front of a laptop screen. This meeting, however, we put the sun to good use, first of all showing off Hursley Park at its best, and then lunching out on the decking at the Clubhouse.</p>
<p>When I was a more frequent attendee of the HantsLUG bring-a-box meetings (where I installed my first <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> distro, and later my first <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>), I&#8217;d often thought how cool it would be to host a meeting at IBM Hursley. But I never got as far as investigating the security and wifi hassles I&#8217;d have to overcome. Fortunately, <a href="http://www.strangeparty.com/">Anton Piatek</a> was a little braver and sent some emails to nearly the right people (who helpfully forwarded them on to really the right people), and suggested his plan to <a href="http://hants.lug.org.uk/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?AdamTrickett">Adam Trickett</a>, Chair of HantsLUG. Adam says he nearly bit Anton&#8217;s hand off and so it happened.</p>
<p>HantsLUG is one of the biggest LUGs in the UK and is our local Linux user group but has surprisingly never really (in the 7 years I&#8217;ve known them) had a huge amount of interaction with IBM Hursley. For a long time, though, there has been a good pool of Linux skills and interest in the Lab, and over the last couple of years the number of people around the Lab voluntarily using Linux as their desktop OS has risen (as has the number of Ubuntu lanyards to be seen as you walk the corridors of Hursley).</p>

<p>So what makes Hursley a good place for a LUG meeting? Well, for a start, it&#8217;s just a really nice place to be &#8211; and Hursley House as well as the Park are very impressive to show off to visitors <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>On Saturday, we were mostly in the Auditorium (where Spitfires were built during WWII), then when we led everyone down to the Clubhouse for lunch, we took the usual site tour scenic route via the Sunken Garden and fish pond. Although Hursley is out in the country, seemingly the middle of nowhere, it&#8217;s actually on the bus-route from Winchester so we had an excellent turnout of about 30 people. IBM Hursley also has a lot of cool people who do cool things that we can tell people about (although one piece of feedback I heard from a LUG person was that they thought we didn&#8217;t talk enough about what IBM does!).</p>

<p>Although we had the House to ourselves, and everyone was free to stand around and chat in the Main Hall, most of the day revolved around talks in the Auditorium. It all kicked off at 11am with an introduction to IBM Hursley (and, of course, directions to the fire exits and toilets) from Anton. The inimitable <a href="http://www.twitter.com/andysc">Andy Stanford-Clark</a>, fresh from a week of press interviews, enthused everyone till lunchtime with tales of mouse traps, <a href="http://mqtt.org">MQTT</a>, twittering houses, twittering ferries, water meters, and energy monitoring. I say &#8216;enthused&#8217; but there must be a better term to describe the way the audience rushed the stage when Andy offered to sell <a href="http://www.currentcost.com">Current Cost</a> monitors at a discount&#8230;</p>
<p>After lunch, we had a collection of shorter talks on a range of topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>I talked about <a href="http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4042">InfoSlicer</a>, the open source software that my <a href="http://www-05.ibm.com/employment/uk/extreme-blue/">Extreme Blue student team</a> developed last Summer and IBM released under the GPL</li>
<li>Anton described the anatomy of Ubuntu packages (he&#8217;s the guy that provides Ubuntu users in IBM with the flawless packages we&#8217;ve come to rely on)</li>
<li><a href="http://tonywhitmore.co.uk">Tony Whitmore</a> related his experiences of producing the popular <a href="http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org">Ubuntu UK Podcast</a> &#8211; and pimped the upcoming <a href="http://oggcamp.org/">OggCamp unconference</a></li>
<li>Adam Trickett, Chair of HantsLUG, gave out free books in return for promises of book reviews on the HantsLUG wiki</li>
</ul>
<p>Then everyone just hung around chatting for ages.</p>
<p>It was a really enjoyable and relaxed day; kudos to Anton, Stephen, and John for organising it from the IBM end. Thanks also to the IBMers who came along and to the many HantsLUG members who turned up. I&#8217;d say it was a success and we should definitely do it again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday lunchtime the auditorium in Hursley House became the venue of an internal &#8220;unconference&#8221; of sorts &#8211; a very relaxed session with a bunch of short, snappy 5 minute presentations by folks from around the lab who related their experiences from different tech conferences.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/dalelane">Dale Lane</a> spoke about Hackdays and Barcamps; <a href="http://twitter.com/aefaradien">Alex Hutter</a> talked about last weekend&#8217;s Barcamp in Brighton; <a href="http://twitter.com/rewbs">Robin Fernandes</a> talked about user groups and his involvement with PHP; <a href="http://twitter.com/iaingavin">Iain Gavin</a> from Amazon Web Services told us about external views on IBM; and <a href="http://twitter.com/andysc">Andy Stanford-Clark</a> was, well, Andy <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I think he may have mentioned something about some service called Twitter, I was&#8217;t really paying attention&#8230; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Most of it was Ignite-style high-speed babble, and mostly without slides.</p>

<p>It was all the brainchild of the brilliant <a href="http://twitter.com/zoe_slattery">Zoe Slattery</a>, who also had some exciting announcements to share with us (more to come on these once I get clearance to post!). There were guest appearances of photographs by <a href="http://twitter.com/alicebartlett">Alice</a>, too.</p>
<p>Oh, and my contribution? I gave a potted, high-speed history of eightbar from the perspective of someone who jumped in to the Hursley world from the outside. Here&#8217;s a pictorial tour. You&#8217;ll note few mentions of virtual worlds &#8211; not because that&#8217;s not something eightbar does anymore, but rather to remind people of the breadth of our interests. Oh, and guess what, the blog has been around for nearly 4 years &#8211; just a week or so to go!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the first Hursley-related things I wrote about here on the <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/2006/03/15/the-genetics-of-dragons-and-the-wisdom-of-monkeys/">eightbar blog</a> back in 2006 was how much I enjoy helping with our annual schools event for National Science and Engineering Week in the UK &#8211; Blue Fusion (the event website has gone AWOL at the moment but <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/uk/en/pressrelease/26865.wss">here&#8217;s a link to the press release</a>).</p>
<p>This year was no exception. This is now the fifth year that I&#8217;ve been a volunteer. Unfortunately I only had room in my schedule to spend one day helping this time around, so I choose to host a school for the day rather than spending all day on a single activity (that way, I got to see all of the different things we had on offer). </p>
<p>So, yesterday I had the pleasure of hosting six intelligent and polite students from <a href="http://www.malvernstjames.co.uk/pages/default.aspx">Malvern St James School</a> and their teachers &#8211; they had travelled a fair distance to come to the event, but despite the early start I think they did really well.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t go into too much detail and spoil the fun for people who might read this but have not yet taken part in this week&#8217;s event, but I think we had some great activities on offer. I <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=&amp;ands=&amp;phrase=&amp;ors=&amp;nots=&amp;tag=&amp;lang=all&amp;from=andypiper&amp;to=&amp;ref=&amp;near=&amp;within=15&amp;units=mi&amp;since=2009-03-09&amp;until=2009-03-09&amp;source=&amp;rpp=50">twittered our way</a> through a few of them. My own personal favourite was a remote surgery activity. You can&#8217;t see much in this image (it was a dark room) but the students basically had a &#8220;body&#8221; inside a box with some remote cameras to guide their hands around and had to identify organs and remove foreign objects. </p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://andypiper.wordpress.com/files/2009/03/img_3774.jpg"><img src="http://andypiper.wordpress.com/files/2009/03/img_3774.jpg?w=300" alt="img_3774" title="img_3774" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1184" /></a></div>
<p>There was also some interesting application of visual technology / tangible interfaces &#8211; a genetics exercise using LEGO bricks and a camera which identified gene strands, and an energy planning exercise which used Reactivision-style markers to identify where power stations had been placed on a map (sort of similar to what we built in <a href="http://andypiper.wordpress.com/2007/06/17/slorpedo/">SLorpedo at Hackday</a> a couple of years ago). We also had some logic puzzles to solve, built a, err&#8230; &#8220;typhoon-proof&#8221; (ahem) tower, simulated a computer processor, and commanded a colony of ants in a battle for survival against the other school teams.</p>
<p>Once again, I thought this was a great event &#8211; just amazing creativity on show from the folks at Hursley in coming up with such engaging exercises. I hope the students had as much fun as I did!</p>
