				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With <a href="http://championships.wimbledon.org">Wimbledon</a> looming large and already qualifying starting this week you may think we are leaving it a little late to complete the build and presence in <a href="http://www.secondlife.com">Second Life</a>. In many ways you would be right. However, we are all giving it some time, knowing full well that we will also build during the event. It has been interesting to see what has happened to some of our scripts, in particular the tennis ball rendering with all the various updates. The base scripts done by Pipe Hesse are still htere, were still active, but seemed to have been damaged a little by the many upgrades that have occured. We are still unsure about representing the ball flow again this year, for various reasons as I alluded to <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/2008/06/09/second-life-live-and-active-web-pages-on-a-prim-i-never-knew-it-did-that/">in the previous post around web page on a prim</a>. For me the complications and social interactions that can happen around collaborative web browsing this year are the key part.<br />
In jointly building this with Andy Remblai, Judge Hocho and Laronzo Fitzgerald we have given ourselves a platform to try some things. I am accutely aware that it will be my stage for 2 weeks too and that being live in world for the event will be as big a challenge as last year, if not more so. Of course if nobody comes to visit next week that too will be a challenge, but I hope that will not be the case. Avatar fingers are crossed as we are 5 days from live (though live is a time for continuous development not a traditional hard stop, this is a virtual world and this a dynamic build environment after all.<br />
