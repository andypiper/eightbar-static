				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s my last day in the office today before <a href="http://rooreynolds.com/2008/07/18/moving-on-from-ibm/">I leave IBM</a>, so it&#8217;s time to have a final cup of tea (and pint of something stronger) with my many friends at Hursley. To mark the occasion, I spent last night building Lego representations of the Emerging Technology Services team, with whom I&#8217;ve had such a great three years. Several of them are contributors to Eightbar, and as well as everyone&#8217;s individual blogs (Twitter, Flickr, etc) of course I will be following Eightbar closely after I&#8217;ve gone to stay in touch with what&#8217;s interesting at IBM.</p>

<p>Thanks for everything.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://jellis.org/">Jason Ellis</a> works in IBM Research and maintains <a href="http://microscopiq.com/">a brilliant blog</a> about art and games. In <a href="http://microscopiq.com/2008/03/impossible-music-manipulation/">a recent post</a>, he links to this demo video for Melodyne&#8217;s new <em>Direct Note Access</em> technology, which looks frankly astonishing.</p>
<div align="center"><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/UE-wrYK8JSY&amp;hl=en"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/UE-wrYK8JSY&amp;hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></div>
<p>As the video shows, exploding a sampled chord allows the kind of editing we&#8217;re already used to with MIDI sequencers, at the individual note level, now from polyphonic recordings. Wow. I&#8217;m particularly blown away by the ability to change the key of a music recording, something I&#8217;d previously not even dreamed of.</p>
<p>Great fun for music makers, but Jason also starts <a href="http://microscopiq.com/2008/03/impossible-music-manipulation/">thinking about the implications for games</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine the kinds of new music games that could be built, making use of music the original developers never heard or even imagined &#8211; building from software that finally understands sound as intimately as the player does.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exciting stuff.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I moderated a panel on virtual worlds, games and social networks at the Virtual Worlds 2008 conference today. I <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/2008/04/01/evolution-of-games-and-social-networks-panel-at-vw08-call-for-questions/">recently put out a request for questions here on Eightbar</a>, and got a great response. Here are my (very poor and woefully incomplete) recollections of the event. I&#8217;m hoping to get a copy of the audio from the event organizers, which will help me flesh this out For now&#8230;</p>
<p />
My three co-panelists introduced themselves</p>
<ul>
<li>Christian Lassonde &#8211; President &#038; Co Founder, <a href="http://www.millionsofus.com/">Millions of Us</a>
</li>
<li>Susan Panico &#8211; Senior Director, Playstation Network, <a href="http://www.sony.com/">Sony</a>
</li>
<li>Sean Ryan &#8211; CEO, <a href="http://www.meez.com/">Meez</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Susan described the attraction of worlds created &#8220;for gamers by gamers&#8221; so I pressed her on whether <a href="http://www.homebetatrial.com/">Home</a> is going to include user generated content. (When Corey Bridges spoke at SXSW, he mentioned that in the late 90s, if you&#8217;d asked people who will be the biggest content producers on the web, people might have guessed &#8216;Disney&#8217;, or other big entertainment brands, and that this turns out not to have been the case. In quite a big way. The creators of the web are everyday people. Does the mentality of user-generated content have any space in the world of Home? (I also mentioned, in a hat-tip to <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/2008/04/01/evolution-of-games-and-social-networks-panel-at-vw08-call-for-questions/#comment-239333">timdp&#8217;s question</a> that she should explain it in terms of what will make Home &#8216;sticky and compulsive&#8217;). Susan conceded that while the experiences would be participatory and social, the content is not going to be user-generated. Christian later revealed that Millions of Us are working with Sony on Home (which was new news to me!)</p>
<p />
I asked a very summary version of <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/2008/04/01/evolution-of-games-and-social-networks-panel-at-vw08-call-for-questions/#comment-239353">David Orban&#8217;s question</a> (I probably didn&#8217;t do it justice, but I pointed out that virtual worlds and games are generally synchronous and realtime, while web based social networks are largely asynchronous. What implications does this have for the future of virtual worlds and social networks?) Everyone agreed that social networks are generally asynchronous, and games are generally synchronous, and all predicated that virtual worlds were bound to become more like social networks in the future. Giff Constable ask a question to clarify that synchronous things don&#8217;t tend to happen in asynchronous spaces (not currently many examples of this in existing social networks) but hinted that increased presence information (&#8220;currently online&#8221;) might gradually augment what we see now (replay, ghost data to simulate synchronous activity in an asynchronous space). I should have pushed harder on this point, because there was a big gap between where everyone agreed we are now and where they all agreed we would obviously end up.</p>
<p />
I asked about walled gardens.<br />
(My friend <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/2008/04/01/evolution-of-games-and-social-networks-panel-at-vw08-call-for-questions/#comment-239329">kybernetikos wanted me to ask this question</a>: Walled gardens have failed (spectacularly and famously) on the web. Yet people are making walled gardens in the fields of games, social networks AND virtual worlds?)<br />
Christian said that he didn&#8217;t expect this to chance in the near future (though mentioned that perhaps in the long term things may be more open). In the short term, he described a business reality in which people have no incentive to help people migrate into a competitive.</p>
<p />
Question from the audience re virtual worlds for learning and education.<br />
Both Sean and Christian agreed with each other that education was not a big sector at the moment. I chipped in with the point that education and business are not mutually exclusive, and that there are lots of ongoing projects with education and training for business.</p>
<p />
Question from the audience about networks which extend beyond one world/game, in which you register your avatar/user for multiple social spaces and share reputation and status in multiple places (including Myrl.com).<br />
Christian pointed out that these had been around for a while, and most have fallen away.</p>
<p />
Final question from the audience on where is this stuff going in 5 years.<br />
Christian says 5 years is particularly hard (1 year is easy. 50/100 years isn&#8217;t too bad. 5 years, someone will hold you to it.)<br />
Pretty much consensus from the panel that virtual worlds are going to be big. Maybe we won&#8217;t talk about social networks and virtual worlds as separate things. I predicted that 2D content will still be around for a very long time (in addition to much more ubiquitous 3D stuff where it makes sense), and also mentioning that I&#8217;d been surprised not to see more Augmented Reality at this conference and to look out for it in the next few years.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ll be moderating a panel at Virtual Worlds 2008 on Friday, entitled &#8216;The Evolution of Games and Social Networks&#8217;. To give you an idea of what we&#8217;ll be talking about, the abstract for the panel describes it thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With the planned introduction of Sony&#8217;s Home for the PlayStation3 and multiple virtual worlds providers now creating widgets for Facebook,  Bebo, and other social<br />
networks, we&#8217;re seeing virtual worlds reach out to every part of the Web and consumer life. This session offers a detailed understanding of how virtual worlds are taking advantage of these emerging distribution formats and how you can leverage Virtual Worlds Everywhere.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll be joined on the panel by some very smart and interesting people, including</p>
<ul>
<li>Christian Lassonde, President &#038; Co Founder, Millions of Us
</li>
<li>Susan Panico, Senior Director, PLAYSTATION Network, Sony Computer Entertainment America
</li>
<li>Sean Ryan, CEO, Meez
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Mark Limber from Google was supposed to be joining us, but I understand that he won&#8217;t be able to make it.)</p>
<p>What would you like me to ask them?</p>
<p>The intersection between virtual worlds and social networking is a pretty big and (hopefully) interesting topic, and should be a well attended session. I&#8217;ve been preparing some discussion points and questions for the other panelists, and I&#8217;d love your input. If you won&#8217;t be there in person, here&#8217;s a chance to let me know where you&#8217;d like to see the discussion go. Specific questions for specific panelists or general topics for discussion are both welcomed. Leave a comment on this post. I&#8217;ll be posting the results after the event (audio? text? video? at least one of those anyway), so think of it as a way of participating remotely and asynchronously. Alternatively, think of it as a blatant lazyweb request to make my own life easier. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<blockquote><p><em><strong>The Virtual Workplace will become the rule.</strong>&nbsp; No need to leave the office.&nbsp; Just bring it along.&nbsp; Desk phones and desktop computers will gradually disappear, replaced by mobile devices, including laptops, that take on traditional office capabilities.&nbsp; Social networking tools and virtual world meeting experiences will simulate the feeling on being their in-person.&nbsp;&nbsp; Work models will be changed by expanded globalisation and green business initiatives that reduce travel and encourage work at home.<br /></em><em>&#8230;<br /></em><em>&#8220;The definition of “meetings” will radically transform and become increasingly adhoc and instantaneous based on context and need.&nbsp; 3-D virtual world and gaming technologies will significantly influence online corporate meeting experiences to deliver more life-like experiences demanded by the next generation workers who will operate more efficiently in this familiar environment.&#8221;<br /><a title="http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/ibm-sounds-death-knell-for-desktop-pc-270127" href="http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/ibm-sounds-death-knell-for-desktop-pc-270127">http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/ibm-sounds-death-knell-for-desktop-pc-270127</a></em></p>

<p>Bruce Morse (IBM VP of Unified Communications and Collaboration) and Steve Mills (IBM Senior VP, Software Group) are both quoted in <strong>a recent eWeek article, which discusses a major investment in UCC</strong>, as well as an announcement about a <strong>partnership with virtual worlds company Forterra Systems</strong>. Specifically, </p>
<ul>
<li><em>So how big is the UCC market now? It&#8217;s still very early for true UCC solutions, according to Bruce Morse, IBM&#8217;s vice president of UCC. &#8220;Unification across the communications silos to the point where you&#8217;re mixing together voice, video, data, etc. with context is still in very much in an embryonic stage in terms of what people are doing.&#8221;<br /></em><a title="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Messaging-and-Collaboration/IBM-Unified-Communications-and-Collaboration-Quest/7/" href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Messaging-and-Collaboration/IBM-Unified-Communications-and-Collaboration-Quest/3/"><em>http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Messaging-and-Collaboration/IBM-Unified-Communications-and-Collaboration-Quest/3/</em></a> </li>
<li><em>Imagine using your Sametime application to set up a virtual meeting. Morse told eWEEK this will be possible in three to five years, as IBM is testing ways to integrate Sametime with virtual reality software, where employee avatars can assemble in virtual conference rooms. Sametime will let users invite other participants and communicate with Web conferencing.<br /></em><a title="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Messaging-and-Collaboration/IBM-Unified-Communications-and-Collaboration-Quest/7/" href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Messaging-and-Collaboration/IBM-Unified-Communications-and-Collaboration-Quest/7/"><em>http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Messaging-and-Collaboration/IBM-Unified-Communications-and-Collaboration-Quest/7/</em></a> </li>
<li><em>For example, IBM and virtual reality software maker Forterra Systems are programming a Sametime-based UCC solution, code-named Babel Bridge, that could allow U.S. intelligence agencies to use a common graphical collaboration system to communicate within a virtual world<br /></em><a title="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Messaging-and-Collaboration/IBM-Unified-Communications-and-Collaboration-Quest/8/" href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Messaging-and-Collaboration/IBM-Unified-Communications-and-Collaboration-Quest/8/"><em>http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Messaging-and-Collaboration/IBM-Unified-Communications-and-Collaboration-Quest/8/</em></a><br /><em>see also: <a href="http://www.virtualworldsnews.com/2008/03/ibm-and-forterr.html">http://www.virtualworldsnews.com/2008/03/ibm-and-forterr.html</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Sametime development manager Konrad Lagarde gave a demo during LotusSphere this year. He demonstrated some early integration between IBM&#8217;s internal Metaverse and Sametime.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>During the presentation, Lagarde text chatted with a participant, also a 3-D avatar, who shows his enthusiasm by jumping up and down. L</em><em>agarde also showed a conference call feature for the Sametime client with pictures of invited attendees arranged around a two-dimensional drawing of a conference table. Those that are already present are shown around the table, while at the bottom of the screen are shaded photos of those who are invited but have not yet arrived. <br /><a title="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/012308-lotusphere-sametime-virtual.html" href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/012308-lotusphere-sametime-virtual.html">http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/012308-lotusphere-sametime-virtual.html</a></em></p>

<p>Dan Pelino, General Manager, IBM Global Healthcare &amp; Life Sciences Industry announced the <strong>IBM Virtual Healthcare Island</strong> in Second Life in February.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“We believe that the use of our new virtual world provides an important, next-generation Internet-based resource to show how standards; business planning; the use of a secured, extensible and expandable architecture; HIE interoperability; and data use for healthcare analytics, quality, wellness and disease management are all helping to transform our industry.“ IBM’s Healthcare &amp; Life Sciences (HCLS) Industry will continue to develop the new island in months to come.&nbsp; The island can perform as a virtually “always on” demonstration tool for IBM’s sales personnel.<br /><a title="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/23580.wss" href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/23580.wss">http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/23580.wss</a></em></p>

<p>Michael Osias of IBM Research is quoted in an announcement about a <strong>3D visualisation of a data centre</strong>, which was implemented using OpenSim.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Implenia, a Swiss construction, building services and real estate company, used the IBM virtual data center solutions to extend its existing virtual operations center which was previously used mainly for the facilities management processes. Adding the data from datacenter equipment allowed Implenia a finer control of the HVAC and security system. The virtual data center is a tailored 3-D replica of servers, racks, networking, power and cooling equipment that allows data center managers to experience real-time enhanced awareness of their dispersed resources.<br />&#8230;<br /></em><em>&#8220;Viewing information about your data center in 2-D text &#8212; even in real time &#8212; only tells a data center manager part of the story, because our brains are wired for sight and sound,&#8221; said IBM Researcher Michael Osias, who architected the 3-D data center service. &#8220;By actually seeing the operations of your data center in 3-D, even down to flames showing hotspots and visualizations of the utilization of servers allows for a clearer understanding of the enterprise resources, better informed decision-making and a higher level of interaction and collaboration.&#8221;<br /></em><a title="http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/1129343/" href="http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/1129343/"><em>http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/1129343/</em></a><br /><em>see also <a title="http://www.virtualworldsnews.com/2008/02/ibm-launches-3.html" href="http://www.virtualworldsnews.com/2008/02/ibm-launches-3.html">http://www.virtualworldsnews.com/2008/02/ibm-launches-3.html</a></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you live in the US, you may have seen an IBM advert recently which has been raising a few eyebrows. People are saying things like &#8220;<a href="http://blaynesucks.com/2008/01/16/hypocritical-ibm-commercials">the company implies that virtual worlds are a fad and, as a result, a waste of both time and money</a>&#8221; and even &#8220;<a href="http://bluepointmktg.blogspot.com/2007/11/stop-talkingstart-doing.html">The ad is an obvious dig at Second Life</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure. I can see why it looks like that, but I&#8217;m not prepared to be annoyed with IBM for damaging its influential position in virtual worlds just yet.</p>
<p>Before I go any further, I should make it clear that I had nothing to do with the making of this ad (if it&#8217;s not perfectly clear already, I don&#8217;t get asked about things like this &lt;grin&gt;). Additionally, I have not even seen the ad yet, I&#8217;ve only read transcripts, so I may be missing some subtle undertones here.</p>
<p>Since I have not watched it, let me allow <a href="http://blaynesucks.com/2008/01/16/hypocritical-ibm-commercials">someone who <em>has</em> watched it to describe it for us</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The commercial starts with an employee showing off his avatar to someone else, presumably a boss. The employee is all pumped about how he can conduct business in this virtual world and how he owns an island there. The boss asks if he can make money. The employee responds with something like, “Virtual money or real money?” This sets up the boss’s response that “The point of innovation is to make actual money.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what to think. Who is the fool here? Is the boss even right? Isn&#8217;t innovation about far more than just making money? (Would training and rehearsal count? What about <a href="http://dusanwriter.wordpress.com/2008/01/16/ibms-project-bluegrass-using-3d-space-to-facilitate-collaboration-demo-photos/">collaboration</a>, recruitment, <a href="http://www.rodenas.org/blog/2007/02/21/ibmrational-codestation-in-second-life/">developer relations</a>, &#8230;)</p>
<p>Based on the transcript (tell me if I&#8217;m wrong), I think there&#8217;s another way of looking at it. What about that ambiguous question: &#8220;virtual money or real money&#8221;? The implication is that the &#8217;employee&#8217; character can&#8217;t use the virtual world to make real money, but everyone <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_18/b3982002.htm">who reads Business Week knows</a> that there <em>is</em> real money to be made in virtual worlds. What if the boss actually &#8220;gets it&#8221; and (unlike the hesitant employee?) knows that real money can be made in virtual worlds, and is pointing this out to him, and us? Suddenly the ad takes on a new perspective. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not at all sure it justifies my broadminded interpretation though, and I&#8217;m as annoyed as anyone that the ad might be interpreted as &#8220;look. aren&#8217;t virtual worlds silly&#8221; and perhaps risk undermining IBM&#8217;s amazing position in this area. What do <strong>you</strong> think?</p>
<p>Update: since this post went up, Ogilvy have posted the ads from this campaign to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/OgilvyIBM">YouTube</a>. Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkEdAxPnLik">avatar advert</a>:<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Someone recently showed me this BT advert from 2002:<em> &#8220;The more connections we make, the more possibilities we have&#8221;.</em></p>
<p align="center"><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Aa0OW6HAuJ0&#038;rel=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Aa0OW6HAuJ0&#038;rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting for many reasons. It nicely sums up the internet of course, but it increasingly reminds me of a popular misconception about virtual worlds. </p>
<p>Yes, the internet is a bit like an auditorium which seats millions of people, and in which we all get a chance to talk to any (and all) of them. But it&#8217;s not <em>exactly</em> like it. If we were creating a 3D digital social space (with ooh, let&#8217;s say, avatars to represent people) would we actually create a great big auditorium to bring them all together at once? Probably not, no. For the same reason that although large numbers of people may come together for specific events in the real world, the number of connections you can make inside a huge crowd doesn&#8217;t scale with the size of the crowd. How many people are you likely to talk to at a sports event, or a music gig, with a thousand people around you? Tens? Hundreds? If the crowd was a million rather than a thousand, would your experience be any better?</p>
<p>The advert itself highlights how ridiculous (though naively adorable and even romantic) the idea of bringing millions of people in one physical space would be, so why is it so easy to obsess about doing the exact same thing with virtual worlds?&nbsp; IBM is not immune from this, and when the 12 IBM islands were first launched you&#8217;ll remember the three large auditoria, capable of holding around 200 people each. </p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/185/426638571_1fa1948b47_o.jpg"><img height="260" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/185/426638571_1fa1948b47_o.jpg" width="400"/></a> </p>
<p>I&#8217;m pleased to say that although these spaces are useful, they&#8217;re used rarely in comparison to the rest of the IBM territory in Second Life. We rarely even attempt to fill these spaces, perhaps because of a realisation that an even bigger and more scaleable approach is needed. We need to (continue to) concentrate on what works on the web: the idea of multiple ongoing and concurrent conversations, with people picking an area (or even environment) which is most appropriate and interesting to them. </p>
<p>Ian just highlighted this very point in <a href="http://eightbar.co.uk/2008/01/17/vr-cave-second-life-and-retail-at-the-nrf/">a post about the recent NRF (National Retail Federation) show</a>, in which a custom shopping experience can be dynamically created. I find the idea of <em>small</em> social environments which can be dynamically created much more interesting than <em>huge </em>social environments which attempt to cater to crowds of unmanageable and unlikely sizes. </p>
