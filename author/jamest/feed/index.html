				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If I don&#8217;t post a few notes from today&#8217;s <a href="http://odcamp.org.uk/">Open Data Camp</a> now, I never will, so here are a few things I scribbled down- it could be worse, I could have posted a PDF containing photos of the the actual scribbles!</p>
<p>So <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ag75qK9Aqm79dGNsbDBHVlJKUnFCbjZNb0V4TVZQc3c&amp;usp=sharing#gid=11">out of this choice</a>&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="https://jtlog.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/odcamp-sessions.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2462" src="https://jtlog.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/odcamp-sessions.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="odcamp-sessions" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230;I picked, Open Data for Elections, Open Addresses, Data Literacy, Designing Laws using Open Data, and Augmented Reality for Walkers.</p>
<h1>Open Data for Elections</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ve been following @<a href="https://twitter.com/floppy">floppy</a>&#8216;s crazy plan to get elected for a while, so this was the easiest decision of the day: what drives someone to embrace the gory inner workings of democracy like this?</p>
<p>Falling turnout it would seem, and concern for a functioning democracy.</p>
<p>The first step of his journey was the <a href="http://openpolitics.org.uk/">Open Politics Manifesto</a>, which I&#8217;ve so far failed to edit- must try harder.</p>
<p>Perhaps more interesting was how this, and use of open data, fits into a political platform as a service. It would be nice to have the opportunity to see a few additions to the usual suspects at the ballot box, and Eastleigh got a rare chance to see what that could be like with a by election. Perhaps open data services for candidates could tip he balance enough to encourage more people to stand.</p>
<p>Things that sounded interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://democracyclub.org.uk/">Democracy Club</a></li>
<li><a href="https://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a></li>
<li><a href="http://data.okfn.org/doc/data-package">Data Packages</a></li>
<li>Open data certificates (food hygiene certificates for data?)</li>
<li>Candidates get one free leaflet delivery by Royal Mail- I wonder how big they expect those leaflets to be!</li>
</ul>
<h1>Open Addresses</h1>
<p>@<a href="http://twitter.com/floppy">floppy</a> and @<a href="https://twitter.com/giacecco">giacecco</a> introduced the (huge) problems they need to overcome to rebuild a large data set without polluting that data with any sources with intellectual property restrictions. <a href="https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/">Open Addresses</a> still have a long way to go and there were comments about how long Open Street Map has been around, and it still has gaps.</p>
<p>They have some fun ideas about crowd sourcing address data (high vis jacket required) and there are some interesting philosophical questions around consent for addresses to be added.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see whether Open Addresses can get enough data to provide real value, and what services they build.</p>
<h1>Data Literacy</h1>
<p>Mark and Laura led a discussion around data literacy founded in the observation that competent people, with all the skills you could reasonably expect them to have, still struggle with handling data sets.</p>
<p>Who needs to be data literate? Data scientists? Data professionals? Everyone?</p>
<p>Data plumbers? There were some analogies with actual plumbers! You might not be a plumber but it&#8217;s useful to know something about it.</p>
<p>If we live in a data driven society, we should know how to ask the right questions. Need domain expertise and technical expertise.</p>
<p>Things that sounded interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Data Cookbook</li>
<li><a href="http://opendatahandbook.org/">Open Data Handbook</a></li>
</ul>
<h1>Designing Laws using Open Data</h1>
<p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/johnlsheridan">johnlsheridan</a> pointed out that the least interesting thing to do with legislation is to publish it and went on to share some fascinating insights into the building blocks of statute law. It sounds like the slippery language used in legislation boils down to a small number of design patterns built with simple building blocks, such as a duty along with a claim right, and so on.</p>
<p>Knowing these building blocks makes it easier to get the gist of what laws are trying to achieve, helps navigate statutes, and could give policy makers a more reliable way to effect a goal.</p>
<p>For example, it&#8217;s easier to make sense of the legislation covering supply of gas, and it&#8217;s possible to identify where there may be problems. The gas regulator has a <em>duty</em> to protect the interests of consumers by promoting competition, but that&#8217;s a weak duty without a clear <em>claim right</em> to enforce it.</p>
<p>John also demonstrated a tool &#8211; <a href="http://ngrams.elasticbeanstalk.com/">http://ngrams.elasticbeanstalk.com</a> &#8211; exploring how the language used in legislation has changed over time, for example how the use of &#8220;shall&#8221; has declined and been replaced by &#8220;is to be&#8221;.</p>
<h1>Augmented Reality for Walkers</h1>
<p>My choice of Android tablet was largely based on what might work reasonably well for maps and augmented reality, so I seized this opportunity!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/nickw">Nick Whitelegg</a> described the Hikar Android app he&#8217;s been working on, which is intended to help hikers follow paths by overlaying map data on a live camera feed.</p>
<p>The data is a combination of Open Street Map mapping data, with Ordnance Survey height data, which is downloaded and cached as tiles around your current location. Open GL is used to overlay a 3D view of the map data on the live camera feed, using the Android sensor APIs to detect the device&#8217;s rotation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just downloaded and installed <a href="http://www.free-map.org.uk/downloads/android/hikar-latest.apk">Hikar</a> and, while my tablet is a tad slow, it works really well. I live somewhere flat and boring but the height data made a noticeable difference when Nick demonstrated the app in hilly Winchester.</p>

I live somewhere flat and boring but the height data made a noticeable difference when Nick demonstrated the app in hilly Winchester.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spurred on by the success of <a href="http://jtlog.wordpress.com/2013/01/04/raspberry-pi-mosquitto/">getting Mosquitto working on a Raspberry Pi</a>, I recently had a play with MQTT on the Joggler. The <a href="http://www.jogglerwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page">O2 Joggler is still a great device for hacking</a> and I currently have <a href="http://birdslikewires.co.uk/articles/squeezeplay-os">SqeezePlay OS</a> running on it.</p>
<p>The reason I wanted to try and get MQTT on the Joggler was to make use of its light sensor, and publish light levels over MQTT. It all turned out to be pretty simple since most of the work has already been done by other people!</p>
<ul>
<li>Andrew de Quincey has <a href="http://code.google.com/p/adqmisc/source/browse/trunk/joggler/readlightsensor.c">code to read the Joggler&#8217;s light sensor</a></li>
<li>Andy Piper has a <a href="http://andypiper.co.uk/2012/03/10/paho-gets-started/">handy quick start guide for Paho</a></li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/paho/files/mqttdoc/Cclient/">MQTT C client documentation</a> has simple publish examples</li>
</ul>
<p>First thing to do was read the light sensor and get that working with an MQTT client. I had to skip some of Andy&#8217;s instructions and just built the client code rather than attempting to get doxygen working. Once I&#8217;d mashed up the light sensor code and publish example I could compile the worlds most pointless MQTT publisher:</p>
<pre>gcc -Wall publightsensor.c -L../bin/linux_ia32 -I../src -lmqttv3c -lpthread -o publightsensor</pre>
<p>Next it was time to check the results. This too was quick and easy thanks to the <a href="http://m2m.eclipse.org/sandbox.html">MQTT sandbox server</a>, which has a handy HTTP bridge. And the final result... was a completely unscientific and <a href="http://m2m-eclipse.cloudfoundry.com/jttest">slightly dingy light level 4</a>! Now I'll be able to turn on a lamp using an unreliable RF controlled socket and see whether it worked or not!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> the code really is all in the existing examples but I've created a Github Gist in case it's any help: <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4753409">mqttjogglermashup.c</a> (11 February 2013)</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/jtlog.wordpress.com/2171/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/jtlog.wordpress.com/2171/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=jtlog.wordpress.com&#038;blog=1751515&%23038;post=2171&%23038;subd=jtlog&%23038;ref=&%23038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<h2>An introduction for those not familiar with the Pi &#8230;</h2>
<p>Yesterday Eben Upton (the guy behind the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a> foundation) took time out of his very busy schedule to give a talk in Hursley. For those who are not familiar with it, the Raspberry Pi (<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs">here is the FAQ</a>) is basically a small credit-card sized computer circuit board with a Broadcom BCM2835 chipset and a 700MHz ARM CPU powered via a microUSB socket, HDMI+composite video output, stereo audio output, ethernet port, 2 USB ports, an SD slot used for booting the device, and another proprietary expansion port, and a high performance graphics subsystem that can decode video at full HD resolution with h.264 (<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1839">MPEG-2 available at extra cost</a>) hardware playback support in XBMC/OpenElec &#8211; all for $35 for the &#8220;model B&#8221; version. They were initially built in China, but much of the manufacturing is now <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1925">in the UK</a> and is therefore supporting the UK economy! Keyboard/mouse/power/screen/SD card are not included in that price, but many people will have suitable ones lying around to connect to it, which certainly suited me as the last thing I need is more of them cluttering the place up.</p>
<p>As someone who was interested in the project from some time prior to the launch it was great to see Eben in person, particularly as I&#8217;m someone who owned a BBC Micro and lost many hours to Elite (co-written by David Braben, who is also involved in the project). If that though is making any of you feel nostalgic, why not try the ZX Spectrum port of <a href="http://www.twinbee.org/hob/play.php?snap=elite">Elite running in a java applet</a>!) The Pi as a project is trying to bring back a bit of that sense of &#8220;playing&#8221; that the BBC Micro probably did better than any other machine of its time.</p>
<p>(Quick disclaimer: This article is a mix of things that Eben spoke about from the notes I took, plus a few extra pieces of background information and external links that I have added myself)</p>
<p>The detailed background to the original idea was something I had not heard in detail before. A director of studies at St.John&#8217;s college in Cambridge, he was concerned by the declining numbers of applicants for computing university positions, as well as a drop in the quality of those applicants (basically changing from getting many people of the type who could likely already code in assembler for two different architectures to a smaller number who&#8217;s experience predominantly &#8220;I know HTML&#8221; &#8211; people who would need more time spent educating them to get to a suitable standard to teach them further) This meant that it would take longer to get them to an adequate standard on the low level aspects of computing &#8211; or by throwing them at Standard ML programming for 6 weeks to make them depressed (I remember going through that!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>BBC Micro comparisons</h2>
<p>I mentioned the BBC Micro in the opening paragraphs &#8211; earlier this year there was a &#8220;<a href="http://beeb30.havnet.positive-internet.com/">Beeb@30</a>&#8221; event to celebrate 30 years of that machine, and here is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15969065">a BBC article looking back on it</a>. It hass been well documented that they did try to get the BBC branding on the device, but the &#8220;unique way the BBC is funded&#8221; means that it was nowhere near as easy for the BBC to support such a commercially available device as happened in the 1980s. Having said that, the ARM-designed processor used in the Pi (and probably, your mobile/cell phone) had is roots in Acorn (<a href="http://www.arm.com/about/company-profile/milestones.php">here is a brief history of ARM</a>) who built the BBC Micro. And there is a &#8211; possibly somewhat indulgent &#8211; project to port RISCOS (the OS designed for the BBC Micro&#8217;s successor &#8211; the Archimedes) to the Pi.</p>
<p>The other thing of note on the Pi is the <a href="http://www.panu.it/raspberry/">GPIO port</a>. Now one of the things that made the BBC Micro special was the inclusion of easy I/O on the device, through the &#8220;user port&#8221; and &#8220;parallel port&#8221;. In fact even the &#8220;joystick&#8221; port was marked as an &#8220;analogue in&#8221; to plant the suggestion it&#8217;s use could extend far beyond games. This allowed a good quality of control of external devices and responding to inputs, something that allows many more interesting control projects to be done with it. At school I did a prototype satellite tracking system using it! But I digress, the GPIO port on the Pi even looks superficially very similar to the user port on the BBC Micro. The most popular interface using it so far is the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1734">Gertboard</a>. (I wish a could remember the name of the blue boards we used on the BBC Micro &#8211; anyone know?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A squashed marketplace</h2>
<p>Another good point raised by Eben was about where the previous marketplace for the BBC Micro and comparable machine has now in modern times. With the home computers of the 80s you powered them on and you got a command prompt for a programming language interpreter that almost begged you to start programming straight away &#8211; almost as though, as Eben said, you had to actively choose not to program! It was easy for anyone to go into their local computer store and make them display scrolling rude messages up the screen, and anyone owning one of those computers would have almost certainly had the knowledge to do so!</p>
<p>Nowadays it is less easy. Games consoles have taken over the high performance graphics market, with high barriers to development entry. It a similar story for the consumer tablets on the market at present &#8211; from a practical perspective the development needs to be done in another environment rather than on the device itself. Even most consumer PCs do not ship with any reasonable programming language out of the box. While that is less of an issue in the high download speed internet of today, during the 90s it took real will and effort to be able to program. The concept of having to choose not to program got completely lost. And that is some of the spirit that the Raspberry Pi is now trying to recreate. It does appear to be a bit of a gap in the market, even ignoring the Cambridge admission quality problem. There are real low-level boards around, but not so much of an all-in-one device like the Pi. And one interesting thought was that the aforementioned relatively simple <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">bloat-free</span> non-content-enriched RISCOS with the ease of switching to a traditional command line from the desktop, could rekindle some of the mentality from the 80s home computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Interest and getting to market</h2>
<p>The amount of early interest in the Pi took the foundation by surprise &#8211; 600,000 views on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/correspondents/rorycellanjones/">Rory Cellan-Jones</a> (BBC Tech correspondent) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ7N4rycsy4"> brief video with Braben</a> &#8211; could that really be an indication of how big the market was for such a device? And could they deliver that many at the target price point, which was pretty much set at $25 from the start (At the time of writing only the $35 model B mentioned in the first paragraph &#8211; which includes a 100Mbit ethernet port, 2 USB ports instead of one and the 512Mb upgrade recently announced &#8211; is shipping). But the foundation has kept to the target price point for the units, and the 512Mb upgrade for the model B has not resulted in a price change. The other remarkable thing was the number of downloads &#8211; in the tens of thousands &#8211; of the SD-card operating system image for the Pi that was released some time before the device was even on sale, so no-one could use it!</p>
<p>The vendor partnerships with Farnell/Element14 and RS were important as it allowed them to move from being a risk-averse charity to more of an IP licensing company to get the number of units they were going to need. And it was a good decision. The first day on sale, as those like me who were up at 6am to order will be aware, was a bit of a disaster (and I <a href="http://goo.gl/Id4dW">blogged to vent my frustration</a> at the time, questioning the motives of many of those buying and how it was pitched by some parts of the media). 100,000 orders were placed by the lucky people who even managed to get to the manufacturing partners (Farnell/Element14 and RS) websites. Both crashed badly under the load, preventing people from buying their resistors or other electronics from those suppliers, not just Pis! A lesson in robust scalable web sites for those two companies.</p>
<p>Another interesting point for those who have been interested in the Pi is that although most of them used in relatively rich countries such as the UK and will therefore make use of the on-board HDMI output (HDMI-DVI-D adapters can be had for under £2 on ebay if needed &#8211; make sure you get male/female as required for your setup!), the Pi also has a composite analogue video output. For me, this is convenient as it allows me to attach it to my in-car screen, but as Eben pointed out it also allows it to be sold in much poorer/emerging countries in the world, where second hand analogue TVs are still in use, and the Pi can give them a new lease of life for a price point far less than, for example, a tablet.</p>
<p>So it was good to have the talk from Eben, and I chatted to him about some other things afterwards. Fantastic to get his time, and of course this blog has been written in a browser running on one of my Pis <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This time of year seems to be hacking season and over the last few days I&#8217;ve been along to two <a href="http://subdigit.com/blog/hackday-explained/">hackdays</a>!</p>
<p>Friday was <a href="http://www.brianodonovan.ie/2012/08/hacking-becomes-mainstream-in-ibm.html">IBM&#8217;s internal Social Business Hackday</a>. There was some MQTT hacking, a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/MartinPacker/entry/hackday_x_batch_analytics_baby_steps42">z/OS hack</a>, hacks with Lotus Connections, hacks that could be the future of Lotus Connections, and I was attempting to hack a work around for a <a href="https://jazz.net/jazz/web/projects/Jazz%20Foundation#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&amp;id=216492">Jazz work item</a>. And that was just at the Hursley local event! We were able to link up with a few other labs, but over two days there were IBMers hacking around the globe. There are going to be a lot of amazing projects to choose from when it comes to voting.</p>
<p><a href="http://jtlog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/webcams.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2086" title="webcams" alt="" src="http://jtlog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/webcams.png?w=300&#038;h=164" height="164" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>(There are a few more photos from HackDay X, and previous hackdays, on the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/hackday_ibm/">IBM hackday group on flickr</a>.)</p>
<p>For round two, today was the <a href="http://southackton.org.uk/2012/09/19/hack-day/">soutHACKton hack day</a>. By the time I arrived the soldering and drilling had already begun!! Unfortunately I wasn&#8217;t able to stay long so I&#8217;m hoping there&#8217;ll me more of these in the future. I did just about have time to try out an idea I had to hack an old doorbell to sense people using the door knocker. A while ago I had accidentally created a touch sensor with a 555 timer while <a href="http://jtlog.wordpress.com/2009/06/22/my-first-currentcost-development-board-circuit/">attempting to build another circuit</a>. So my cunning plan was to deliberately create a <a href="http://fritzing.org/projects/digital-input-555-touch-switch/">555 touch switch</a> and connect it to the bolt on the inside of the front door. Unfortunately the best I could manage today was a two wire touch sensor, which isn&#8217;t going to work. At least not without leaving a wire hanging out of the letter box with some instructions attached! Unless someone who knows more about electronics can suggest a plan B, I may just resort to a boring doorbell button instead!!</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/jtlog.wordpress.com/2085/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/jtlog.wordpress.com/2085/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=jtlog.wordpress.com&#038;blog=1751515&%23038;post=2085&%23038;subd=jtlog&%23038;ref=&%23038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This time of year seems to be hacking season and over the last few days I&#8217;ve been along to two <a href="http://subdigit.com/blog/hackday-explained/">hackdays</a>!</p>
<p>Friday was <a href="http://www.brianodonovan.ie/2012/08/hacking-becomes-mainstream-in-ibm.html">IBM&#8217;s internal Social Business Hackday</a>. There was some MQTT hacking, a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/MartinPacker/entry/hackday_x_batch_analytics_baby_steps42">z/OS hack</a>, hacks with Lotus Connections, hacks that could be the future of Lotus Connections, and I was attempting to hack a work around for a <a href="https://jazz.net/jazz/web/projects/Jazz%20Foundation#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&amp;id=216492">Jazz work item</a>. And that was just at the Hursley local event! We were able to link up with a few other labs, but over two days there were IBMers hacking around the globe. There are going to be a lot of amazing projects to choose from when it comes to voting.</p>
<p><a href="https://jtlog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/webcams.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2086" title="webcams" alt="" src="https://jtlog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/webcams.png?w=300&#038;h=164" height="164" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>(There are a few more photos from HackDay X, and previous hackdays, on the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/hackday_ibm/">IBM hackday group on flickr</a>.)</p>
<p>For round two, today was the <a href="http://southackton.org.uk/2012/09/19/hack-day/">soutHACKton hack day</a>. By the time I arrived the soldering and drilling had already begun!! Unfortunately I wasn&#8217;t able to stay long so I&#8217;m hoping there&#8217;ll me more of these in the future. I did just about have time to try out an idea I had to hack an old doorbell to sense people using the door knocker. A while ago I had accidentally created a touch sensor with a 555 timer while <a href="https://jtlog.wordpress.com/2009/06/22/my-first-currentcost-development-board-circuit/">attempting to build another circuit</a>. So my cunning plan was to deliberately create a <a href="http://fritzing.org/projects/digital-input-555-touch-switch/">555 touch switch</a> and connect it to the bolt on the inside of the front door. Unfortunately the best I could manage today was a two wire touch sensor, which isn&#8217;t going to work. At least not without leaving a wire hanging out of the letter box with some instructions attached! Unless someone who knows more about electronics can suggest a plan B, I may just resort to a boring doorbell button instead!!</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/jtlog.wordpress.com/2085/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/jtlog.wordpress.com/2085/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=jtlog.wordpress.com&#038;blog=1751515&%23038;post=2085&%23038;subd=jtlog&%23038;ref=&%23038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Something I&#8217;ve really wanted to have a go at for a long time is hacking together a smarter heating system. The long process of moving house prevented any progress until now but I think a few things fell in to place today to get the project off the ground. And so a slightly mad thermostat plan was hatched&#8230;</p>
<p>The first part of the puzzle is a side effect of getting a solar water panel; to make the most of the solar panel we should only be using the boiler to top up the hot water at the end of the day. (Obviously that&#8217;s just theoretical at the moment because its pretty much been raining non stop since we got the solar panel!) Unfortunately the current central heating controller will only turn on the heating if the hot water is on at the same time, which is no help at all, so we really need a new controller to make the most of our zero carbon supply of hot water. There&#8217;s another, purely aesthetic reason to want a new heating controller; the <a href="http://jtlog.wordpress.com/2012/04/19/whats-cooking/">kitchen upgrade</a> got under way this week and the old controller has seen better days.</p>
<p><a href="http://jtlog.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/current-controller.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1973" title="current-controller" src="http://jtlog.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/current-controller.jpg?w=300&#038;h=240" alt="" width="300" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>The current kitchen destruction has a bigger part to play though; now is an ideal opportunity to hide cables behind the new cupboards. For a while that didn&#8217;t actually seem like it was going to be all that much help, based on where the old thermostat was (hidden behind a door in the living room). I was looking at various programmable thermostats but the existing wiring from the thermostat restricted the options somewhat. The programmable thermostat we had in the old house seemed to work quite well with the existing wiring and controller&#8230; as long as the battery was fresh, otherwise it got confused about the temperature. Obviously not ideal for a thermostat, so I was hoping to avoid batteries this time!</p>
<p>Then, while being distracted by the wonky light switches yet again, inspiration struck&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://jtlog.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/light-switches.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1974" title="light-switches" src="http://jtlog.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/light-switches.jpg?w=300&#038;h=240" alt="" width="300" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>The house hasn&#8217;t been constructed with the greatest care in the world, but those switches just could not have been original. The only thing that makes sense is if they were another botched DIY job, and it seemed highly unlikely that anyone would have dropped another cable run down the wall to do it. My hunch, based on the fact that there&#8217;s a water cylinder directly above those switches, is that there&#8217;s a horizontal cable run between the two. I checked, and&#8230; eureka! So now it&#8217;s a simple job to put both switches back on the same box, leaving an empty recessed box with a now bare kitchen wall behind it, making it perfect to run a new thermostat cable through the back of the box and round to the boiler! (Well I was pretty excited by this plan at the time.)</p>
<p>The thermostat to finish off this puzzle is a <a href="http://www.heatmisershop.co.uk/epages/Heatmiser.sf/en_GB/?ObjectPath=/Shops/Heatmiser/Products/%22PRTHW-N%20V3%22/SubProducts/%22PRTHW-N%20V3%22">Heatmiser combined programmable thermostat and hot water timer</a>. My theory is that I need the PRT/HW-N thermostat to go in the living room and a <a href="http://www.heatmisershop.co.uk/epages/Heatmiser.sf/en_GB/?ObjectPath=/Shops/Heatmiser/Products/%22Power%20Relay%22">PRC powered relay card</a> in place of the old central heating controller. I&#8217;m almost certain that the wiring will work with the existing system anyway, but if anyone has any experience/tips/gotchas, please let me know! That programmable thermostat should give me an RS485 interface to the thermostat which, if all goes well, won&#8217;t be too difficult to connect to my <a href="http://jtlog.wordpress.com/2011/08/21/nanode-343/">nanode</a>- either with a bit of soldering, or one of these <a href="http://robosavvy.com/store/product_info.php/products_id/1554">IO shields</a> if I&#8217;m feeling lazy! The thing I like about this arrangement is that it should be possible to achieve plenty of automation if all goes well but, if there are any technical hitches, there&#8217;s a decent off the shelf controller to fall back on.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> a quick update since I&#8217;m doing some head scratching over whether the existing wiring from the central heating timer to the junction box in the airing cupboard will allow the heating to run independently from the hot water. If it does, the new thermostat is in place ready to go&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://jtlog.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/heatmiser-thermostat.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1995" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://jtlog.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/heatmiser-thermostat.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>If it doesn&#8217;t, the new thermostat will just be a decorative feature while I figure out where I can sneak a new cable upstairs without disturbing the new kitchen! I don&#8217;t want to break the heating until I&#8217;m sure everything will work, so I&#8217;m working off a photo for now&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://jtlog.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/central-heating-wiring.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1996" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://jtlog.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/central-heating-wiring.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to hear from anyone who can decipher that lovely nest of wires! Here&#8217;s my theroy so far:</p>
<p>The black cable is the valve, and the other two cables that enter with it at the bottom are the pump and cylinder stat. It looks to me like the grey cable should be to turn the hot water off, which seems to be connected to the cylinder stat and a red wire from one of the cables above, which I&#8217;m hoping is from the timer. That just seems too easy for this house though, and I&#8217;m a bit puzzled by what the connections on the orange wire actually are. Lucky it&#8217;s all neatly connected and labelled so I can check the orange wire is connected to the cylinder stat and pump&#8230; bother. I guess I&#8217;m going to have to wait until Jo&#8217;s not looking so I can investigate more thoroughly!</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/jtlog.wordpress.com/1969/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/jtlog.wordpress.com/1969/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=jtlog.wordpress.com&#038;blog=1751515&%23038;post=1969&%23038;subd=jtlog&%23038;ref=&%23038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
