				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I organised a fund raising &#8216;BAKING DAY&#8217; for charity at work yesterday (in Hursley) to raise money for <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/pudsey/">Children In Need</a>.  It was a brilliant day, so many people brought in home-baked goodies, cakes, muffins, cookies, biscuits, brownies, fudge etc and we sold them ALL. We raised quite a lot of money and had a fun day :o)</p>
<p>We counted the money yesterday and added the UK tax return thingy (if you are a UK resident), and it came upto just under £300. However we still have a couple of games and raffles that we haven&#8217;t collected the money for, so I will update you with our latest funds raised soon.</p>
<p>To see photos of what my colleagues and I baked please check out <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hanan/">my pics</a>.</p>
<p>Here is an example:<br />

<b>Who We Are Helping:</b><br />
Children In Need is an annual event that raises money and gives it  to charities and projects that work to improve the lives of children and young people throughout the UK.</p>
<p>The donated money goes towards many things including helping children with severe physical disabilities, helping underprivileged children while their mother receives treatment for a life-threatening medical condition,<br />
looking after children with cancer,  paying for therapy sessions for sexually-abused children, paying for counselling sessions for children affected by violence at home etc.</p>
